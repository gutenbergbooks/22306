FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="indent">
This book was written, originally and primarily, for use in a course
entitled "Introduction to Contemporary Civilization," required
of all Freshmen in Columbia College. It is an attempt to give a
bird's-eye view of the processes of human nature, from man's simple
inborn impulses and needs to the most complete fulfillment of these
in the deliberate activities of religion, art, science, and morals.
It is hoped that the book may give to the student and general reader
a knowledge of the fundamentals of human nature and a sense of
the possibilities and limits these give to human enterprise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Part I consists of an analysis of the types of behavior, a survey
of individual traits and their significance in social life, a brief
consideration of the nature and development of the self, individual
differences, language and communication, racial and cultural continuity.
Those fruits of psychological inquiry have been stressed which
bear most strikingly on the relations of men in our present-day
social and economic organization. In consequence, there has been a
deliberate exclusion of purely technical or controversial material,
however interesting. The psychological analysis is in general based
upon the results of the objective inquiries into human behavior
which have been so fruitfully conducted in the last twenty-five
years by Thorndike and Woodworth. To the work of the first-mentioned,
the author is particularly indebted.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Part II is a brief analysis, chiefly psychological in character, of the
four great activities of the human mind and imagination&mdash;religion,
art, science, and morals. These are discussed as normal though
complex activities developed, through the process of reflection,
in the fulfillment of man's inborn impulses and needs. Thus
descriptively to treat these spiritual enterprises implies on the
part of the author a naturalistic viewpoint whose main outlines
have been fixed for this generation by James, Santayana, and Dewey.
To the last-named the writer wishes to express the very special
obligation that a pupil owes to a great teacher.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_iv"><span class="page">Page iv</span></a> The book
as a whole, so far as can be judged from the experience the author
and others have had in using it during the past year as a text
at Columbia, should fit well into any general course in social
psychology. It has been increasingly realized that the student's
understanding of contemporary problems of government and industry is
immensely clarified by a knowledge of the human factors which they
involve. This volume supplies a brief account of the essential facts
of human behavior with especial emphasis on their social consequences.
Part I may be independently used, as it has been with success, in
a general course in social psychology. Part II, the "Career of
Reason," presents material which many instructors find it highly
desirable to use in introductory philosophy courses, but for which
no elementary texts are available. The usual textbooks deal with
the more metaphysical problems to the exclusion of religion, art,
morals, and science, humanly the most interesting and significant of
philosophical problems. Where, as in many colleges, the introductory
philosophy course is preceded by a course in psychology, the arrangement
of the volume should prove particularly well suited.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The illustrative material has been drawn, possibly to an unusual
extent, from literature. The latter seems to give the student in the
vivid reality of specific situations facts which the psychologist
is condemned, from the necessities of scientific method, to discuss
in the abstract.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The book follows more or less closely that part of the syllabus
for the course in Contemporary Civilization, which is called "The
World of Human Nature," which section of the outline was chiefly
the joint product of collaboration by Professor John J. Coss and
the author. To the former the author wishes to express his large
indebtedness. Also to Miss Edith G. Taber, for her careful and
valuable editing of the manuscript in preparation for the printer,
he desires to convey his deep appreciation.

INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent">
<b>Human traits and civilization.</b> Throughout the long enterprise
of civilization in which mankind have more or less consciously
changed the world they found into one more in conformity with their
desires, two factors have remained constant: (1) the physical order
of the universe, which we commonly call Nature, and (2) the native
biological equipment of man, commonly known as human nature. Both
of these, we are almost unanimously assured by modern science,
have remained essentially the same from the dawn of history to
the present. They are the raw material out of which is built up
the vast complex of government, industry, science, art&mdash;all
that we call civilization. In a very genuine sense, there is nothing
new under the sun. Matter and men remain the same.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while this fundamental material is constant, it may be given
various forms; and both Nature itself and the nature of man may,
with increasing knowledge, be increasingly controlled in man's
own interests. The railroad, the wireless, and the aeroplane are
striking and familiar testimonies to the efficacy of man's informed
mastery of the world into which he is born. In the field of physical
science, man has, in the short period of three centuries since
Francis Bacon sounded the trumpet call to the study of Nature and
Newton discovered the laws of motion, magnificently attained and
appreciated the power to know exactly what the facts of Nature are,
what consequences follow from them, and how they may be applied
to enlarge the boundaries of the "empire of man."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In his control of human nature, which is in its outlines as fixed
and constant as the laws that govern the movements of the stars, man
has been much less conscious and deliberate, and more frequently moved
by passion and ignorance than by reason and knowledge. Nevertheless,
custom and law, <a name="page_x"><span class="page">Page x</span></a>
the court, the school, and the market have similarly been man's
ways of utilizing the original equipment of impulse and desire
which Nature has given him. It is hard to believe, but as certain
as it is incredible, that the modern professional and businessman,
moving freely amid the diverse contacts and complexities pictured
in any casual newspaper, in a world of factories and parliaments
and aeroplanes, is by nature no different from the superstitious
savage hunting precarious food, living in caves, and finding every
stranger an enemy. The difference between the civilization of an
American city and that of the barbarian tribes of Western Europe
thousands of years ago is an accurate index of the extent to which
man has succeeded in redirecting and controlling that fundamental
human nature which has in its essential structure remained the same
through history.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Man's ways of association and co&ouml;peration, for the most part,
have not been deliberately developed, since men lived and had to
live together long before a science of human relations could have
been dreamed of. Only to-day are we beginning to have an inkling of
the fundamental facts of human nature. But it has become increasingly
plain that progress depends not merely on increasing our knowledge
and application of the laws which govern man's physical environment.
Machinery, factories, and automatic reapers are, after all, only
instruments for man's welfare. If man is ever to attain the happiness
and rationality of which philosophers and reformers have continually
been dreaming, there must also be an understanding of the laws which
govern man himself, laws quite as constant as those of physics
and chemistry.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Education and political organization, the college and the legislature,
however remote they may seem from the random impulses to cry and
clutch at random objects with which a baby comes into the world,
must start from just such materials as these. The same impulse
which prompts a five-year-old to put blocks into a symmetrical
arrangement is the stuff out of which architects or great executives
are made. <a name="page_xi"><span class="page">Page xi</span></a>
Patriotism and public spirit find their roots back in the same
unlearned impulses which make a baby smile back when smiled at,
and makes it, when a little older, cry if left too long alone or
in a strange place. All the native biological impulses, which are
almost literally our birthright, may, when understood, be modified
through education, public opinion, and law, and directed in the
interests of human ideals.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is the aim of this book to indicate some of these more outstanding
human traits, and the factors which must be taken into account if
they are to be controlled in the interests of human welfare. It is
too often forgotten that the problems which are to be dealt with in
the world of politics, of business, of law, and education, are much
complicated by the fact that human beings are so constituted that
given certain situations, they will do certain things in certain
inevitable ways. These problems are much clarified by knowing what
these fundamental ways of men are.

HUMAN&nbsp;TRAITS&nbsp;AND&nbsp;THEIR<br />
SOCIAL&nbsp;SIGNIFICANCE
</p>

<p class="part">PART I</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subtitle">TYPES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The human animal.</b> Any attempt to understand what the nature
of man is, apart from its training and education during the life
of the individual, must start with the realization that man is a
human animal. As a human being he is strikingly set off by his
upright posture and his large and flexible hand. But chiefly he is
distinguished by his plastic brain, upon which depends his capacity
to perform the complex mental activities&mdash;from administering
a railroad to solving problems in calculus&mdash;which constitute
man's outstanding and exclusive characteristic.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The thinking process is discussed in detail in chapters
III and XIV.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But in his structure and functions man bears, as is now well known,
a marked resemblance to the lower animals. His respiratory and
digestive organs, for example, may be duplicated as far down in
the animal scale as birds and chickens.[2] Man's whole physical
apparatus and mode of life, save in complexity and refinement of
operations, are the same as those of any of the higher mammals.
But more important for the student of human behavior, man's mental
life&mdash;that is, his way of responding to and dealing with his
environment&mdash;is in large part identical with that of the lower
animals, especially of the most highly developed vertebrates, such
as the monkey. They have, up to a certain point, precisely the <a
name="page_2"><span class="page">Page 2</span></a> same equipment
for adjusting themselves to the conditions of life. Apart from
education, both man and animal are endowed with a set of more or
less fixed tendencies to respond in specific ways to specific stimuli.
These inborn or congenital tendencies are generally known as reflexes
or instincts.[1] These are unlearned ways, exhibited by both human
and animal organisms, of responding promptly and precisely, and
in a comparatively changeless manner to a given stimulus from the
environment. These tendencies to act, while they may be, and most
frequently are of advantage to the organism, are not conscious or
acquired. They are irresistible impulses to do just such-and-such
particular things in such-and-such particular ways when confronted
with just such-and-such particular situations. In the well-known
words of James:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: With certain modifications accounted for in their
historical "descent" with modification from a common ancestor. See
Scott: <i>Theory of Evolution</i>.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The difference between the two is largely one of
complexity. By a reflex is meant a very simple and comparatively
rigid response; by an instinct a series of reflexes such that when
the first is set off, the remainder are set off in a regularly
determinate succession.]
</p>

<p class="include">
The cat runs after the mouse, runs or shows fight before the dog,
avoids falling from walls and trees, shuns fire and water, etc.,
not because he has any notion either of life or death, or of
self-preservation. He has probably attained to no one of these
conceptions in such a way as to react definitely upon it. He acts
in each case separately, and simply because he cannot help it;
being so framed that when that particular running thing called a
mouse appears in his field of vision he <i>must</i> pursue; that
when that particular barking and obstreperous thing called a dog
appears there he <i>must</i> retire, if at a distance, and scratch
if close by; that he <i>must</i> withdraw his feet from water,
and his face from flame.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. II, p. 384.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Similarly, the baby's reaching for random objects, and sucking them
when seized, its turning its head aside, when it has had enough
food, its crying when alone and hungry, are not, for the most part,
deliberate methods invented by the infant to maintain its own welfare,
but are almost as automatic as the number of sounds omitted by the
cuckoo clock at midnight.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_3"><span class="page">Page 3</span></a> Why do men
always lie down, when they can, on soft beds rather than on hard
floors? Why do they sit round the stove on a cold day? ... Why
does the maiden interest the youth so that everything about her
seems more important and significant than anything else in the
world? Nothing more can be said than that these are human ways,
and that every creature <i>likes</i> its own ways, and takes to the
following of them as a matter of course.... Not one man in a billion,
when taking his dinner, thinks of utility. He eats because the food
tastes good, and makes him want more. If you ask him <i>why</i>
he should want to eat more of what tastes like that, instead of
revering you as a philosopher, he will probably laugh at you for
a fool.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. II, p. 386.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
These inborn tendencies to act vary in complexity from the withdrawing
of a hand from a hot stove or the jerking of the knee when touched
in a particular spot to startlingly involved trains of action to
be found in the behavior of certain of the lower animals. Bergson
cites the case of a species of wasp which with a skill, unconscious
though it be, resembling that of the expert surgeon, paralyzes
a caterpillar without killing it, and carries it home for food
for its young.[2] There are again many cases of "insects which
invariably lay their eggs in the only places where the grubs, when
hatched, will find the food they need and can eat, or where the
larv&aelig; will be able to attach themselves as parasites to some
host in a way that is necessary to their survival."[3] In many
instances these complicated trains of action are performed by the
animal in a situation absolutely strange to it, without its ever
having seen the act performed before, having been born frequently
after its parents had died, and itself destined to die long before
its grubs will have hatched.

<p class="indent">
<b>The number and variety of man's instincts.</b> Various attempts
have been made, notably by such men as James, McDougall, and Thorndike,
to enumerate and classify the tendencies with which man is at birth
endowed, or which, <a name="page_4"><span class="page">Page 4</span></a>
like the sex instinct, make their appearance at a certain stage
in biological growth, regardless of the particular training to
which the individual has been subjected. Earlier classifications
were inclined to speak of instincts as very general and as half
consciously purposeful in character. Thus it is still popularly
customary to speak of the "instinct of self-preservation," the
"instinct of hunger," and the "parental instinct." The tendency of
present-day psychology is to note just what responses take place
in given specific situations. As a result of such observation,
particularly by such biologists as Watson and Jennings,[1] instincts
have come to be regarded not as general and purposive but as specific
and automatic. Thus it is no instinct of self-preservation that
drives the child to blink its eyes at a blinding flash of light;
it is solely and simply the very direct and immediate tendency to
blink its eyes in just that way whenever such a phenomenon occurs.
It is no deliberate intent to inhale the oxygen necessary to the
sustenance of life that causes us to breathe. No more is it a conscious
plan to provide the organism with nourishment that prompts us to
eat our breakfast in the morning; it is simply the immediate and
irresistible enticement of food after a night's fast. Not a deliberate
motive of maternity prompts the mother to caress and care for her
baby, but an inevitable and almost invincible tendency to "cuddle
it when it cries, smile when it smiles, fondle it and coo to it
in turn."

of the Lower Organisms</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the last few years, as a result of the observation of animals
under laboratory conditions, there has been increasing evidence of
a large number of specific tendencies to act in specific ways, in
response to specific given stimuli. As no stimuli are ever quite alike,
and no animal organism is ever in exactly the same physico-chemical
condition at two different times, there are slight but negligible
differences in response. Allowing for these, animals may be said
to be equipped with a wide variety of tendencies to do precisely
the same things under recurrent identical circumstances. The aim
of the <a name="page_5"><span class="page">Page 5</span></a>
experimental psychologist is to discover just what actions occur
when an animal is placed in any given circumstances, precisely
as the chemist notes what reaction occurs when two chemicals are
combined.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While experiments with the human infant are more difficult and rare
(and while it is among infants alone among humans that original
tendencies can be observed free from the modifications to which
they are so soon subjected by training and environment) careful
observers find in the human animal also a great number of these
specific ways of acting. Just which of the large number of observed
universal modes of behavior are original and unlearned, is a matter
still in controversy among psychologists. There is practically
complete agreement among them, however, with respect to such
comparatively simple acts as grasping, reaching, putting things
in the mouth, creeping, standing and walking, and the making of
sounds more or less articulate. Most psychologists recognize even
such highly complicated tendencies as man's restlessness in the
absence of other people, his tendency to attract their attention
when present, to be at once pitying and pugnacious, greedy and
sympathetic, to take and to follow a lead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In general, it may be said that man possesses not fewer instincts
than animals, but more. His superiority consists in the fact that
he has at once more tendencies to respond, and that in him these
tendencies are more flexible and more susceptible of modification
than those of animals. A chicken has at the start the advantage
over the human; it can at first do more things and do them better.
But it is the human baby who, though it cannot find food for itself
at the start, can eventually be taught to distinguish between the
nutritive values of food, secure food from remote sources, and
make palatable food from materials which when raw are inedible.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An inventory and classification of man's original tendencies is
made more difficult precisely because these are so easily modifiable
and are, even in earliest childhood, seldom seen in their original
and simple form.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_6"><span class="page">Page 6</span></a> At any given
time a human being is being acted upon by a wide variety of competing
and contemporaneous stimuli. In walking down a street with a friend,
for example, one may be attracted by the array of bright colors,
of flowers, jewelry and clothing in the shop windows, blink one's
eyes in the glare of the sun, feel a satisfaction in the presence
of other people and a loneliness for a particular friend, dodge
before a passing automobile, be envious of its occupant, and smile
benevolently at a passing child. It would be difficult in so complex
and so characteristically familiar a situation to pick out completely
and precisely the original human tendencies at work, and trace
out all the modifications to which they have been subjected in
the course of individual experience. For even single responses
in the adult are not the same in quality or scope as they were
to start with. Even the simplest stimuli of taste and of sound
are different to the adult from what they are to the child. What
for the adult is a printed page full of significance is for the
baby a blur, or at most chaotic black marks on white paper.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while it is difficult to disentangle out of even a simple,
everyday occurrence the original unlearned human impulses at work,
experimentation on both humans and animals seems clearly to establish
that "in the same organism the same situation will always produce
the same response." It also seems clear that in man these native
unlearned responses to given stimuli are unusually numerous and
unusually controllable. Upon the possibility of the ready modification
of these original elements in man's behavior his whole education
and social life depend.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Learning in animals and men.</b> Men and animals are alike not
only in that they have in common a large number of tendencies to
respond in definite ways to definite stimuli, but that these responses
may be modified, some strengthened through use, and others weakened
or altogether discarded through disuse. In both also the survival
and strengthening of some native tendencies, the weakening and even
the complete <a name="page_7"><span class="page">Page 7</span></a>
elimination of others, depends primarily upon the satisfaction
which flows from their practice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be remembered that any situation, while it calls forth
on the part of the organism a characteristic response, may also
call out others, especially if the first response made fails to
secure satisfaction, or if it places the animal in a positively
annoying situation. There are certain situations&mdash;being fed
when hungry, resting when weary, etc.&mdash;which are immediate and
original satisfiers; there are others such as bitter tastes, being
looked at with scorn by others, etc., which are natural annoyers.
The first type the animal will try various means of attaining; the
second, various means of avoiding. Through "trial and error," through
going through every response it can make to a given situation, the
animal or human hits upon some response which will secure for it
satisfaction or rid it of a positive annoyance. Once this successful
response is hit upon, it tends to be retained and becomes habitual
in that situation, while other random responses are eliminated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As will be pointed out in the following, man has developed in the
process of reflection a much more effective and subtle mode of
attaining desirable results, but a large part of human acquisition
of skill, whether at the typewriter, the piano, the tennis court,
or in dealing with other people, is still a matter of making every
random response that the situation provokes until the appropriate
and effective one is hit upon, and making this latter response more
immediately upon repeated experiences in the same situation. Once
this effective response becomes habitual it is just as automatic
in character as if it had been made immediately the first time,
and it is almost impossible without knowledge of the animal's or
the human's earlier modes of response to detect the difference
between an acquired response and one that is inborn.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This process of trial and error is perhaps best illustrated in the
behavior of the lower animals where careful experiments have been
conducted for the purpose of tracing the process of learning. In
the classic cases reported by Thorndike and <a name="page_8"><span
class="page">Page 8</span></a> Watson, when chickens, rats, and cats
were placed in situations where the first response failed to bring
satisfaction, their behavior was in each case marked by the following
features. At the first trial the animals in every case performed a
wide variety of acts useless to secure the satisfaction they were
instinctively seeking, whether it was food in a box, or freedom
from confinement in a cage. Upon repeated trials the act appropriate
to securing satisfaction was performed with increasing elimination
of useless acts, and consequent decrease of the time required to
perform the act requisite to secure food, or freedom, or both,
as the case might be. One of Thorndike's famous cat experiments
is best told in his own report:
</p>

<p class="include">
If we take a box twenty by fifteen by twelve inches, replace its
cover and front side by bars an inch apart, and make in this front
side a door arranged so as to fall open when a wooden button inside
is turned from a vertical to a horizontal position, we shall have
means to observe such [learning by trial and error]. A kitten,
three to six months old, if put in this box when hungry, a bit of
fish being left outside, reacts as follows: It tries to squeeze
through between the bars, claws at the bars, and at loose things
in and out of the box, stretches its paws out between the bars,
and bites at its confining walls. Some one of all these promiscuous
clawings, squeezings, and bitings turns round the wooden button,
and the kitten gains freedom and food. By repeating the experience
again and again the animal gradually comes to omit all the useless
clawings, and the like, and to manifest only the particular impulse
(<i>e.g.</i>, to claw hard at the top of the button with the paw or
to push against one side of it with the nose) which has resulted
successfully. It turns the button around without delay whenever
put in the box. It has formed an association between the situation
<i>confined in a box with a certain appearance</i> and the response
of <i>clawing at a certain part of that box in a certain definite
way</i>. Popularly speaking, it has learned to open a door by pressing
a button. To the uninitiated observer the behavior of the six kittens
that thus freed themselves from such a box would seem wonderful and
quite unlike their ordinary accomplishments of finding their way
to their food or beds.... A certain situation arouses, by virtue
of accident or more often instinctive equipment, certain responses.
One of these happens to be an act appropriate to secure freedom.
It is stamped in in connection with that situation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>Educational Psychology</i>, Briefer Course.
p. 129.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_9"><span class="page">Page 9</span></a> Perhaps the
most significant factor to be noted in this, and in similar cases,
is that the successful response to a baffling situation is acquired,
and that this acquisition remains a more or less permanent possession
of the human or animal organism. Particularly important for the problem
and practice of education is the mechanism by which these learned
modes of behavior are acquired. For, to attain skill, knowledge,
intellect, character, is to attain certain determinate habits of
action, certain recurrent and stable ways of responding to a situation.
The reason why the cat in the box ceased to perform the hundred
and one random acts of clawing and biting, and after a number of
trials got down to the immediately necessary business of turning
the button was because it had learned that one thing only, out
of the multitude of things it could do, would enable it to get
out of the box and get its food. To say that it learned this is
not to say that it consciously realized it; it means simply that
when placed in such a situation again after having been placed in
it a sufficient number of times, it will be set off to the turning
of the button which gets it food, instead of biting bars and clawing
at random&mdash;actions which merely serve further to frustrate its
hunger. The animal has not consciously learned, but its nervous
system has been mechanically directed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A large part of the education of humans as well as of animals consists
precisely in the modification of our original responses to situations
by a trial-and-error discovery of ways of attaining satisfactory
and avoiding annoying situations. Both animals and humans, when
they have several times performed a certain act that brings
satisfaction, tend, on the recurrence of a similar situation, to
repeat that action immediately and to eliminate with successive
repetitions almost all the other responses which are possible, but
which are ineffective in the attainment of some specific satisfaction.
The whole training imposed by civilization on the individual is
based ultimately on this fundamental fact that human beings can
be taught to modify their behavior, to change their original <a
name="page_10"><span class="page">Page 10</span></a> response to
a situation in the light of the consequences that follow it. This
means that while man's nature remains on the whole constant, its
operations may be indefinitely varied by the results which follow
the operation of any given instinct. The child has its original
tendency to reach toward bright objects checked by the experience
of putting its hand in the flame. Later his tendency to take all
the food within reach may be checked by the looks of scorn which
follow that manifestation of man's original greed, or the punishment
and privation which are correlated with it. Through experience
with punishment and reward, humans may be taught to do precisely
the opposite of what would have been their original impulse in any
given situation, just as the monkey reported by one experimenter
may be taught to go to the top of his cage whenever a banana has
been placed at the bottom.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The prolonged period of infancy.</b> Probably the most significant
and unique fact of human behavior is the period of "prolonged infancy"
which is characteristic of human beings alone. Fiske and Butler in
particular have stressed the importance of this human trait. In
the lower animals the period of infancy&mdash;that is, the period
during which the young are dependent upon their parents for food,
care, and training&mdash;is very short, extending even in the highest
form of ape to not more than three months. This would appear, at
first blush, to be a great advantage possessed by the lower animals.
They come into the world equipped with a variety of tendencies to
act which, within a week, or, as in the case of chickens, almost
immediately after birth, are perfectly adapted to secure for them
food, shelter, and protection. They are mechanisms from the beginning
perfectly adjusted to their environment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The human infant, while it is born with a greater number of instinctive
activities than other animals, is able to make little use of them just
as they stand. For years after birth it is helplessly dependent on
others to supply its most elementary needs. It must be fed, carried,
and sheltered; it cannot by <a name="page_11"><span class="page">Page
11</span></a> itself even reach for an object, and it cannot for
nearly two years after birth specifically communicate its wants
to other people. But this comparatively long helplessness of the
human infant is perhaps the chief source of human progress.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The human baby, because it can do so little at the start, because
it has so many tendencies to act and has them all so plastic,
undeveloped, and modifiable, has to a unique degree the capacity
to learn. This means that it can profit by the experience of others
and adjust itself to a great variety and complexity of situations.
The chicken or the bird can do a limited number of things perfectly,
but it is as if it had a number of special keys opening special locks.
The power of modifying these instinctive adjustments, the capacity
of learning, is like being put in possession of a pass-key. As
Professor Dewey puts it, "An original specialized power of adjustment
secures immediate efficiency, but, like a railway ticket, it is good
for one route only. A being who, in order to use his eyes, ears,
hands, and legs, has to experiment in making varied combinations of
their reactions, achieves a control that is flexible and varied."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey; <i>Democracy and Education</i>, p. 53.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The more complex the environment is in which the individual must
live, the longer is the period of infancy needed in which the necessary
habits and capacities may be acquired. In the human being the period
of infancy extends in a literal sense through the first five years of
the individual's life. But in civilized societies it extends factually
much longer. By the end of the first five years the child's physical
infancy is over. It can take care of itself so far as actually feeding
itself, moving about, and communicating with others is concerned.
But so complex are the habits to which it must become accustomed
in our civilization that it is dependent for a much longer period.
The whole duration of the child's education is a prolongation of
the period of infancy. In most civilized countries, until at least
the age of twelve, the child is literally dependent on its parents.
And with every advance in civilization <a name="page_12"><span
class="page">Page 12</span></a> has come a lengthening in the period
of education, or learning.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Intellectually, the period of infancy might be said not really
to be over before the age of twenty-five, by which time habits
of mind have become fairly well fixed. The brain and the nervous
system remain fairly plastic up to that time, and if inquiry and
learning have themselves become habitual, plasticity may last even
longer. In the cases of the greatest intellects, of a Darwin, or
a Newton, one might almost say the period of infancy lasts to old
age. To be still learning at sixty is to be still a child in the
best sense of the word. It is still to be open rather than rigid,
still to be profiting by experience.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The great social advantages of the prolonged period of infancy
lie in the fact that there is a unique opportunity both for the
acquisition by individuals and for the imposition on the part of
society of a large number of habits of great social value. The
human being, born into a world where there are many things to be
learned both of natural law and human relations, is, as it were,
fortunately born ignorant. He has instincts which are pliable enough
to be modified into habits, and in consequence socially useful
habits can be deliberately inculcated in the immature members of
a society by their elders. The whole process of education is a
utilization of man's prolonged period of infancy, for the deliberate
acquisition of habits. This is all the more important since only by
such habit formation during the long period of human infancy can
the achievements of civilization be handed down from generation
to generation. Art, science, industrial methods, social customs,
these are not inherited by the individual as are the instincts
of sex, pugnacity, etc. They are preserved only because they can
be taught as habits to those beings who come into the world with
a plastic equipment of instincts which lend themselves for a long
time to modification.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Consciousness of self and reaction to ideas.</b> A significant
difference between the actions of human beings and those of <a
name="page_13"><span class="page">Page 13</span></a> animals is
that human beings are conscious of themselves as agents. They may
be said not only to be the only creatures who know what they are
doing, but the only ones who realize their individuality in doing
it. Dogs and cats are not, so far as we can draw inferences from
extended observation of even their most complex actions, conscious
of themselves. It is not very long, however, before the human animal
begins to set itself off against the remainder of the universe, to
discover that it is something different from the chairs, tables,
and surrounding people and faces that at first constitute for it
only a "blooming, buzzing confusion." A human being performs actions
with a feeling of awareness; he is conscious of himself. This
consciousness of self (see chapters VII and VIII) becomes more
acute as the individual grows older. It has consequences of the
gravest character in social, political, and economic life. It is
a large factor at once in such different qualities of character
as ambition, friendship, humility, and self-sacrifice, and is
responsible in large measure for whatever truth there is in the
familiarly spoken-of conflict between "the individual and society."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Human beings are, furthermore, susceptible to a unique stimulation
to action, namely, ideas. Animals respond to things only, that
is, to things in gross:
</p>

<p class="include">
It may be questioned whether a dog <i>sees</i> a rainbow any more
than he apprehends the political constitution of the country in
which he lives. The same principle applies to the kennel in which
he sleeps and the meat that he eats. When he is sleepy, he goes to
the kennel; when he is hungry, he is excited by the smell and color
of meat; beyond this, in what sense does he see an <i>object?</i>
Certainly he does not see a house&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a thing with all
the properties and relations of a permanent residence, <i>unless</i>
he is capable of making what is present a uniform sign of what is
absent&mdash;unless he is capable of thought.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>How We Think</i>, p. 17.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Human beings can respond to objects as <i>signs</i> of other things,
and, what is perhaps more important, can abstract from those gross total
objects certain qualities, features, elements, <a name="page_14"><span
class="page">Page 14</span></a> which are universally associated with
certain consequences. They can respond to the meaning or bearing
of an object; they can respond to ideas.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To respond to ideas means to respond to significant similarities
in objects and also to significant differences. It means to note
certain qualities that objects have in common, and to classify
these common qualities and their consequences in the behavior of
objects. To note similarities and differences in the behavior of
objects is to enable individuals to act in the light of the future.
The printing on this page would be to a dog or to a baby merely
a blur. To the reader the black imprints are signs or symbols.
To the animal a red lantern is a haze of light; to a locomotive
engineer it is a sign to halt. To respond to ideas is thus to act
in the light of a future. It makes possible acting in the light of
the consequences that can be foreseen. Present objects or features
of objects are responded to as signs of future or absent opportunities
or dangers. Every time we read a letter, or act in response to
something somebody has told us, we are responding not to physical
stimuli as such, but to those stimuli as signs of other things.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Human beings alone possess language.</b> The value of the period
of infancy in the acquisition of habits and the unique ability of
human beings to respond to ideas is inseparably connected with the
fact that man alone possesses a language, both oral and written.
That is to say, men alone have an instrument whereby to communicate
to each other feelings, attitudes, ideas, information. To a very
limited degree, of course, animals have vocal and gesture habits;
specific cries of hunger, of sex desire, or distress. But they
cannot, with their limited number of vocal mechanisms, possibly
develop language habits, develop a system of sounds associated with
definite actions and capable of controlling actions. Only human
beings can produce even the simplest system of written symbols, by
which visual stimuli become symbols of actions, objects, emotions,
or ideas. Biologists&mdash;in particular the experimentalist, <a
name="page_15"><span class="page">Page 15</span></a> Watson&mdash;find,
in the capacity for language, man's most important distinction from
the brute.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Language may be said, in fact, to be the most indispensable instrument
of civilization. It is the means whereby the whole life of the past
has been handed to us in the present. It is the means whereby we
in turn record, preserve, and transmit our science, our industrial
methods, our laws, our customs. If human relations were possible at
all without a language, they would have to begin anew, without any
cultural inheritance, in each generation. Education, the transmitter
of the achievements of the mature generation to the one maturing, is
dependent on this unique human capacity to make seen marks and heard
sounds stand for other things. The extent to which civilization may
advance is contingent upon the development of adequate language
habits. And human beings have perfected a language sufficiently
complicated to communicate in precise and permanent form their
discoveries of the complex relations between things and between
men.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Man the only maker and user of tools.</b> One of the most important
ways in which man is distinguished from the lower animals is in
his manufacture and use of tools. So far as we know the ability
to manufacture and understand the use of tools is possessed by
man alone. "Monkeys may be taught a few simple operations with
tools, such as cracking nuts with a stone, but usually they merely
mimic a man."[1] Man's uniqueness as the exclusive maker and user
of tools is made possible by two things. The first is his hand,
which with its four fingers and a thumb, as contrasted with the
monkey's five fingers, enables him to pick up objects. The second
is his capacity for reflection, presently to be discussed, which
enables him to foresee the consequences of the things he does.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mills: <i>The Realities of Modern Science</i>, p. 1.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The use of tools of increasing refinement and complexity is the
chief method by which man has progressed from the life of the cave
man to the complicated industrial civilization of to-day. Bergson
writes in this connection:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_16"><span class="page">Page 16</span></a> As regards
human intelligence, it has not been sufficiently noted that mechanical
invention has been from the first its essential feature, that even
to-day our social life gravitates around the manufacture and use
of artificial instruments, that the inventions which strew the
road of progress have also traced its direction. This we hardly
realize, because it takes us longer to change ourselves than to
change our tools. Our individual and even social habits survive
a good while the circumstances for which they were made, so that
the ultimate effects of an invention are not observed until its
novelty is already out of sight. A century has elapsed since the
invention of the steam engine, and we are only just beginning to
feel the depths of the shock it gave us. But the revolution it
has effected in industry has nevertheless upset human relations
altogether. New ideas are arising, new feelings are on the way
to flower. In thousands of years, when, seen from the distance,
only the broad lines of the present age will still be visible,
our wars and our revolutions will count for little, even supposing
they are remembered at all; but the steam engine and the procession
of inventions that accompanied it, will perhaps be spoken of as we
speak of the bronze or of the chipped stone of prehistoric times:
it will serve to define an age. If we could rid ourselves of all
pride, if, to define our species, we kept strictly to what the
historic and the prehistoric periods show us to be the constant
characteristic of man and of intelligence, we should not say <i>Homo
sapiens</i>, but <i>Homo faber</i>.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bergson: <i>Creative Evolution</i>, pp. 138-39.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Man's intelligence, it has so often been said, enables him to control
Nature, but his intelligence in the control of natural resources
is dependent for effectiveness on adequate material instruments.
One may subscribe, though with qualification, to Bergson's further
statement, that "intelligence, considered in what seems to be its
original feature, is the faculty of manufacturing artificial objects,
especially tools to make tools, and of indefinitely varying the
manufacture."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Anthropologists distinguish the prehistoric epochs, by such terms
as the Stone, Copper or Bronze, and Iron Ages, meaning thereby
to indicate what progress man had made in the utilization of the
natural resources about him. We date the remote periods of mankind
chiefly by the mementos we have of the kinds of tools they used
and the methods they had <a name="page_17"><span class="page">Page
17</span></a> developed in the control of their environment. The
knowledge of how to start and maintain a fire has been set down as
the practical beginning of civilization. Certainly next in importance
was the invention of the simplest tools. There came in succession,
though &aelig;ons apart, the use of chipped stone implements, bronze
or copper instruments, and instruments made of iron. In the ancient
world we find the invention of such simple machines as the pulley,
the use of rope, and the inclined plane.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Without tracing the history of invention, it will suffice for our
purpose to point out that agriculture and industry, men's modes of
exploiting Nature, are dependent intimately on the effectiveness of
the tools at their disposal. It is a far cry from the flint hatchet
to the McCormick reaper and the modern steel works, but these are
two ends of the same process, that process which distinguishes
man from all other animals, and makes human civilization possible:
that is, the use and the manufacture of tools.

CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
TYPES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND THEIR SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE&mdash;INSTINCT,
HABIT, AND EMOTION
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Instinctive behavior.</b> We have already noted the fact that
both men and animals are equipped with a wide variety of unlearned
responses to given stimuli. In the case of human beings, this original
equipment varies from such a specific reaction as pulling away the
hand when it is pinched or burned, to such general innate tendencies
as those of herding or playing with other people. In a later stage
of this discussion we shall examine the more important of these
primary modes of behavior. At this point our chief concern is with
certain general considerations that apply to them all.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The equipment of instincts with which a human being is at birth
endowed must be considered in two ways. It consists, in the first
place, of definite and unlearned mechanisms of behavior, fixed
original responses to given stimuli. These are, at the same time,
the original driving forces of action. An instinct is at once an
unlearned mechanism for making a response and an unlearned tendency
to make it. That is, given certain situations, human beings do
not simply utilize inborn reactions, but exhibit inborn drives
or desires to make those reactions. There is thus an identity in
man's native endowment between what he can do and what he wants
to do. Instincts must thus be regarded as both native capacities
and native desires.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Instincts define, therefore, not only what men can do, but what
they want to do. They are at once the primary instruments and the
primary provocatives to action. As we shall presently see in some
detail, human beings may acquire mechanisms of behavior with which
they are not at birth endowed. These acquired mechanisms of response
are called <a name="page_19"><span class="page">Page 19</span></a>
habits. And with the acquisition of new responses, new motives
or tendencies to action are established. Having learned how to
do a certain thing, individuals at the same time learn to want
to do it. But just as all acquired mechanisms of behavior are
modifications of some original instinctive response, so all desires,
interests, and ideals are derivatives of such original impulses
as fear, curiosity, self-assertion, and sex. All human motives
can be traced back to these primary inborn impulses to make these
primary inborn responses.[1]

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The clearest statement of the status of instincts as
both mechanisms of action and "drives" to action has been made by
Professor Woodworth in his <i>Dynamic Psychology</i>. No one else,
to the best of the author's knowledge, has made the distinction
with the same clarity and emphasis, though it has been suggested in
the work of Thorndike and McDougall. In McDougall's definition of an
instinct he recognizes both the responsive self and the tendency to
make the response. An instinct is, for him, an inherited disposition
which determines its possessor, in respect to any object, "to act
in regard to it in a particular manner, or at least to experience
an impulse to such action."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The necessity for the control of instinct.</b> The human being's
original equipment of impulses and needs constitutes at once an
opportunity and a problem. Instincts are the natural resources of
human behavior, the raw materials of action, feeling, and thought.
All behavior, whether it be the "making of mud pies or of metaphysical
systems," is an expression, however complicated and indirect, of
some of the elements of the native endowments of human beings.
Instinctive tendencies are, as we have seen, the primary motives
and the indispensable instruments of action. Without them there
could be no such thing as human purpose or preference; without
their utilization in some form no human purpose or preference could
be fulfilled. But like other natural resources, men's original
tendencies must be controlled and redirected, if they are to be
fruitfully utilized in the interests of human welfare.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are a number of conditions that make imperative the control of
native tendencies. The first of these is intrinsic to the organization
of instincts themselves. Human beings are born with a plurality
of desires, and happiness consists in <a name="page_20"><span
class="page">Page 20</span></a> an equilibrium of satisfactions. But
impulses are stimulated at random and collide with one another.
Often one impulse, be it that of curiosity or pugnacity or sex,
can be indulged only at the expense or frustration of many others
just as natural, normal, and inevitable. There is a certain school
of philosophical radicals who call us back to Nature, to a life
of unconsidered impulse. They paint the rapturous and passionate
moments in which strong human impulses receive satisfaction without
exhibiting the disease and disorganization of which these indulgences
are so often the direct antecedents. A life is a long-time enterprise
and it contains a diversity of desires. If all of these are to
receive any measure of fulfillment there must be compromise and
adjustment between them; they must all be subjected to some measure
of control.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A second cause for the control of instinct lies in the fact that
people live and have to live together. The close association which
is so characteristic of human life is, as we shall see, partly
attributable to a specific gregarious instinct, partly to the increasing
need for co&ouml;peration which marks the increasing complexity
of civilization. But whatever be its causes, group association
makes it necessary that men regulate their impulses and actions
with reference to one another. Endowed as human beings are with
more or less identical sets of original native desires, the desires
of one cannot be freely fulfilled without frequently coming into
conflict with the similar desires of others. Compromise and adjustment
must be brought about by some intelligent modification both of
action and desire. The child's curiosity, the acquisitiveness or
sex desire or self-assertiveness of the adult must be checked and
modified in the interests of the group among which the individual
lives. One may take a simple illustration from the everyday life
of a large city. There is, for most individuals, an intrinsic
satisfaction in fast and free movement. But that desire, exhibited
in an automobile on a crowded thoroughfare, will interfere with
just as normal, natural, and inevitable desires on the part of
other motorists and pedestrians.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_21"><span class="page">Page 21</span></a> Still another
imperative reason for the control of our instinctive equipment
lies in the fact that instincts as such are inadequate to adjust
either the individual or the group to contemporary conditions. They
were developed in the process of evolution as useful methods for
enabling the human animal to cope with a radically different and
incomparably simpler environment. While the problems and processes
of his life and environment have grown more complex, man's inborn
equipment for controlling the world he lives in has, through the
long history of civilization, remained practically unchanged. But
as his equipment of mechanisms for reacting to situations is the
same as that of his prehistoric ancestors, so are his basic desires.
And the satisfaction of man's primary impulses is less and less
attainable through the simple, unmodified operation of the mechanisms
of response with which they are associated. In the satisfaction of
the desire for food, for example, which remains the same as it
was under primitive forest conditions, much more complex trains of
behavior are required than are provided by man's native equipment.
To satisfy the hunger of the contemporary citizens of New York
or London requires the transformation of capricious instinctive
responses into systematic and controlled processes of habit and
thought. The elaborate systems of agriculture, transportation, and
exchange which are necessary in the satisfaction of the simplest
wants of men in civilization could never be initiated or carried
on if we depended on the instincts with which we are born.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are thus seen to be at least three distinct reasons why our
native endowment of capacities and desires needs control and direction.
In the life of the individual, instinctive desires must be adjusted
to one another in order that their harmonious fulfillment may be
made possible. The desires and native reactions of individuals must
be checked and modified if individuals are to live successfully
and amiably in group association, in which they must, in any case,
live. And, finally, so vastly complicated have become the physical
and the <a name="page_22"><span class="page">Page 22</span></a>
social machinery of civilized life that it is literally impossible
to depend on instincts to adjust us to an environment far different
from that to which they were in the process of evolution adapted.
In the light of these conditions men have found that if they are to
live happily and fruitfully together, certain original tendencies
must be stimulated and developed, others weakened, redirected, and
modified, and still others, within limits possibly, altogether
repressed. Individuals display at once curiosity and fear, pity
and pugnacity, acquisitiveness and sympathy. Some of these it has
been found useful to allow free play; others, even if moderately
indulged, may bring injury to the individual and the group in which
his own life is involved. Education, public opinion, and law are more
or less deliberate methods society has provided for the stimulation
and repression of specific instinctive tendencies. Curiosity and
sympathy are valued and encouraged because they contribute,
respectively, to science and to co&ouml;peration; pugnacity and
acquisitiveness must be kept in check if people are not simply
to live, but to live together happily.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the substitution of control for caprice in the living-out of
our native possibilities is as difficult as it is imperative. As
already noted, instincts are imperious driving forces as well as
mechanisms. While we can modify and redirect our native tendencies
of fear, curiosity, pugnacity, and the like, they remain as strong
currents of human behavior. They can be turned into new channels;
they cannot simply be blocked. Indeed, in some cases, it is clearly
the social environment that needs to be modified rather than human
behavior. Though it be juvenile delinquency for a boy to play baseball
on a crowded street, it is not because there is intrinsically anything
unwholesome or harmful in play. What is clearly demanded is not
a crushing of the play instinct, but better facilities for its
expression. A boy's native sociability and gift for leadership
may make him, for want of a better opportunity, a gangster. But to
cut off those impulses altogether would be to cut off the sources
of good citizenship. The settlement <a name="page_23"><span
class="page">Page 23</span></a> clubs or the Boy Scout organizations
in our large cities are instances of what may be accomplished in
the way of providing a social environment in which native desires
can be freely and fruitfully fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Social conditions can thus be modified so as to give satisfaction
to a larger proportion of natural desires. On the other hand,
civilization in the twentieth century remains so divergent from
the mode of life to which man's inborn nature adapts him that the
thwarting of instincts becomes inevitable. Impulses, in the first
place, arise capriciously, and one of the conditions of our highly
organized life is regularity and canalization of action. Our businesses
and professions cannot be conducted on the spontaneous promptings
of instinct. The engineer, the factory worker, the business man,
cannot allow themselves to follow out whatever casual desire occurs
to them whenever it occurs. Stability and regularity of procedure,
demanded in most professions, are incompatible with random impulsive
behavior. To facilitate the effectiveness of certain industries,
for example, it may be necessary to check impulses that commonly
receive adequate satisfaction. Thus it may be essential to enforce
silence, as in the case of telephone operators or motormen, simply
because of the demands of the industry, not because there is anything
intrinsically deserving of repression in the impulse to talk.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, the mere fact that a man lives in a group subjects him to a
thousand restraints and restrictions of public opinion and law. A
child may come to restrain his curiosity when he finds it condemned
as inquisitiveness. We cannot, when we will, vent our pugnacity on
those who have provoked it; we cannot be ruthlessly self-assertive
in a group; or gratify our native acquisitiveness by appropriating
anything and everything within our reach.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But because there are all these social forces making for the repression
of instincts, it does not mean that these latter therefore disappear.
If any one of them is unduly repressed, it does not simply vanish
as a driving force in human behavior. <a name="page_24"><span
class="page">Page 24</span></a> It will make its enduring presence
felt in roundabout ways, or in sudden extreme and violent outbursts.
Or, if it cannot find even such sporadic or fruitive fulfillments,
"a balked disposition" will leave the individual with an uneasiness
and irritation that may range from mere pique to serious forms
of morbidity and hysteria. A man may for eight or ten hours be
kept repeating the same operation at a machine in a factory. He
may thereby repress those native desires for companionship and for
variety of reaction which constitute his biological inheritance.
But too often postponed satisfaction takes the violent form of
lurid, over-exciting amusements and dissipation. The suppression of
the sex instinct not infrequently results in a morbid pruriency in
matters of sex, a distortion of all other interests and activities
by a preoccupation with the frustrated sex motive. Assaults and
lynchings, and the whole calendar of crimes of violence with which
our criminal courts are crowded, are frequent evidence of the
incompleteness with which man's strong primary instincts have been
suppressed by the niceties of civilization. The phenomenal outburst
of collective vivacity and exuberance which marked the reported
signing of the armistice at the close of the Great War was a striking
instance of those immense primitive energies which the control and
discipline of civilization cannot altogether repress.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There has been, furthermore, a great deal of evidence adduced in
recent years by students of abnormal psychology concerning the
results of the frustration of native desires. When the individual
is "balked" in respect to particular impulses or desires, these may
take furtive and obscure fulfillments; they may play serious though
obscure and unnoticed havoc with a man's whole mental life. Unfulfilled
desires may give rise to various forms of "complex," distortions of
thought, action, and emotion of which the individual himself may
be unaware. They may make a man unduly sensitive, or fearful, or
pugnacious. He may, for example, cover up a sense of mortification
at failure by an unwarranted degree of <a name="page_25"><span
class="page">Page 25</span></a> bluster and brag. A particular
baffling of desire may be compensated by a bitterness against the
whole universe or by a melancholy of whose origin the victim may
be quite unconscious. These maladjustments between an individual's
desires and his satisfactions are certainly responsible for a
considerable degree of that irritation and neurasthenia which are
so frequently observable in normal individuals.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: While the evidence in this field has been taken largely
from extremely pathological cases, the distortions and perversions
of mental behavior, noticeable in such cases, are simply extreme
forms of the type of distortion that takes place in the case of
normal individuals whose desires are seriously frustrated. See the
very clear statement on the subject of "repressions" and "conflicts"
in R. B. Hart's <i>Psychology of Insanity</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The facts enumerated above should make it clear why it is difficult
to modify, much less completely to overcome, these strong original
drives to action. They serve to emphasize the fact that by control
of instinctive responses is not meant their suppression. For just
as instinctive tendencies are our basic instruments of action, so
instinctive desires are our basic ingredients of happiness. Just as
all we can do is limited by the mechanisms with which we are endowed,
so what we want is ultimately determined by the native desires with
which we are born. The control of action and of desire is justified
in so far as such control will the more surely promote a harmonious
satisfaction of all our desires. A society whose arrangements are
such that instincts are, on the whole, being repressed rather than
stimulated and satisfied, is frustrating happiness rather than
promoting it. At the very least, a life whose natural impulses
are not being fulfilled is a life of boredom. The ennui which is so
often and so conspicuously associated with the routine and desolate
"gayeties" of society, the listlessness of those bored with their
work or their play, or both, are symptoms of social conditions where
the native endowments of man are handicaps rather than assets, dead
weights rather than motive forces. It means that society is working
against rather than with the grain. Discontent, ranging from mere
pique and irritability to overt violence, is <a name="page_26"><span
class="page">Page 26</span></a> the penalty that is likely to be
paid by a society the majority of whose members are chronically
prevented from satisfying their normal human desires. No one who
has seen whole lives immeasurably brightened by the satisfaction
of a suitable employment, or melancholy and irritability removed by
companionship and stimulating surroundings, can fail to realize
how important it is to happiness that human instincts be given
generous opportunity for fulfillment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One may say, indeed, that the evils of too complete repression
of individual impulses are more than that they produce nervous
strain, dissatisfaction, and, not infrequently, crime. Happiness,
as Aristotle long ago pointed out, is a complete living-out of all
a man's possibilities. It is most in evidence when people are, as
we say, doing what they like to do. And people like to do that which
they are prompted to do by the nature which is their inheritance.
Freshness, originality, and spontaneity are perhaps particularly
valued in our own civilization because of the multiple restraints of
business and professional occupations. Even under the most perfect
social arrangements there will always exist among men conflicts of
desire. Their control over their environment will, of necessity,
be imperfect, as will their mastery of their own passions and their
clear adjustment to one another. That complete agreement between
man's desires and the environment in which alone they can find
their satisfaction remains at best an ideal. But it is an ideal
which indicates clearly the function of control. This is obviously
not to crush native desires, but to organize their harmonious
fulfillment. Where men have an opportunity to utilize their native
gifts they will be satisfied and interested; where native capacities
and desires are continually balked, men will be discontented though
well-regimented machines.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Habitual behavior.</b> Except for purposes of analysis, life
on the purely instinctive level may be said scarcely to exist in
contemporary society, or for that matter, since the beginnings
of recorded history. As has been already pointed out, <a
name="page_27"><span class="page">Page 27</span></a> while men are
born with an even wider variety of tendencies to act than animals,
these are much more plastic and modifiable, more susceptible of
training, and much more in need of it than those of the sub-human
forms. Even among animals under conditions of domestication, instinct
tends largely to be replaced by habitual or acquired modes of behavior.
The human being, born with a nervous system and a brain in extremely
unformed and plastic condition, is so susceptible to every influence
current in his environment that most of his actions within a few
years after birth are, when they are not the result of deliberate
reflection, secondary or habitual rather than genuinely instinctive.
That is, few of the simplest actions of human beings are not in some
degree modified by experience. They may appear just as automatic
and immediate as if they were instinctive, and indeed they are,
but they are learned ways rather than the unlearned ways man has
as his possession at birth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The mechanism of habit.</b> The implications of habitual behavior
can better be understood after a brief analysis of the mechanism
of such action. An instinct has been defined as a tendency to act
in a given way in response to a given stimulus. What happens when
a stimulus prompts the organism to respond in a given way, is that
some sensory nerve, whether of taste or touch or sound, sight,
smell, or muscular sensitivity, receives a stimulus which passes
through the spinal cord to a motor nerve through which some muscle
is "innervated" and a response made. In the simplest type of reflex
action, such as the winking of an eye in a blinding light, or the
withdrawing of a hand from flame, such is the physiology of the
process. But where an immediate adjustment cannot be made by an
instinctive response, where satisfaction is not secured by the
passage of a sensory stimulus to an immediate motor response, the
nervous impulse is, as it were, deflected to the brain area, auditory,
visual, or whatever it may be, which is associated with that particular
type of sensation. The path to the brain area is far from simple;
the nervous impulse, <a name="page_28"><span class="page">Page
28</span></a> which might be compared to an electric current, must
pass through many nerve junctions known as "synapses," at which
points there is some not completely understood chemical resistance
offered to the passage of the nerve current. On passing through
the network of nerves in the brain area, the current passes back
again through a complicated maze of connections to a motor nerve
which insures a muscular response. The first time a stimulus passes
through this network the resistance offered at the nerve junction
or synapse is very high; at succeeding repetitions of the stimulus
the resistance is reduced, the nerve current passes more rapidly
and fluently over the paths it has already traveled, and the action
resulting becomes as direct and automatic as if it were an original
reflex action.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See McDougall: <i>Physiological Psychology</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The acquisition of new modes of response.</b> Expressed in less
technical language this means simply that human beings can learn
by experience, and that they tend to repeat actions they have once
learned. Where an animal is perfectly adjusted to its environment,
all stimuli issue in immediate and nicely adjusted responses. This
happens only where the environment is very simple and stable, and
where in consequence no complexity of structure or action is necessary.
In the clam and the oyster, and in some of the lower vertebrates,
perhaps, instinctive activity is almost exclusively present. But
in the case of man, so complicated are the situations to which he
is exposed that random instinctive responses will not solve his
problems. He must, as with his highly modifiable nervous system
he can, acquire new modes of response which will, in the complexity
of new situations serve as effectively as his original tendencies
to act would serve him in a simpler and stabler environment. A
human being in a modern city cannot live by instinct alone; he
must acquire an enormous number of habits to meet the variety of
complex situations he meets in daily life. A monkey exists with
fairly fixed native tendencies to act. But civilization <a
name="page_29"><span class="page">Page 29</span></a> could never
have developed if in man new ways could not be acquired to meet
new situations, and if these new ways could not be retained and
made habitual in the individual and the race.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Trial and error and deliberate learning.</b> Whenever, as happens
a large number of times daily in the life of the average man, old
ways of response, inborn or formerly acquired, are inadequate to
meet a new situation, there are two methods of acquiring a new
and more adequate response. One is the method of trial and error,
already discussed, whereby animals and humans try every possible
instinctive response to a situation until one brings satisfaction
and is retained as a habitual reaction when that situation recurs.
The other is a delay in response, during which delay reflection, a
consideration of possible alternatives, and a conscious decision,
take place. The technique of this latter process will be discussed
more specifically in the next chapter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Whether acquired by trial and error, or through reflection, learned
acts are, the first time they are performed, frequently imperfect,
only partly effective, and performed with some difficulty. With
successive repetitions their performance becomes more rapid, more
immediate, and more adjusted to the specific situation to be met.
And as they become more familiar responses to familiar stimuli
they cease to be conscious at all. They are performed with almost
as little difficulty or attention as normal breathing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Some conditions of habit-formation.</b> The acquisition of habits
is so important in the education of human beings that the conditions
under which they can be acquired and made permanently effective
have been closely studied. From experiments certain fundamental
conclusions stand out. A habit is acquired by repetition, and the
"curves of learning" show certain recurrent features. In the first
few repetitions of an acquired activity, there is progress in the
rapidity, effectiveness, and accuracy with which the response is
made. There is, up to a certain point, an almost vertical rise
in the <a name="page_30"><span class="page">Page 30</span></a>
learning curve. After varying numbers of repetitions, depending
somewhat on the particular individual, there occur what are known
as "plateaux," during which no progress in speed or accuracy of
response is to be observed. In experiments with the learning of
typewriting, for example, it has been found that the beginner makes
rapid progress up to the point, say, where he can write fifty words
a minute without error; there is a long interval not infrequently
before he can raise his efficiency to the point of writing seventy
words a minute correctly. Analogous conditions have been observed
in the speed with which the sending and receiving of telegraphic
messages is learned. These "plateaux" of learning are sometimes to
be accounted for by muscular fatigue. Frequently there is actual
progress in learning during these apparent intervals of marking
time. Some of the less observable features of skill in performance
which only later become overt in speed and accuracy are being attained
during these seemingly profitless and discouraging intervals. Not
infrequently in the acquisition of skill in the playing of tennis
or the piano, or in the solution of mathematical problems, a decided
gain in skill and speed comes after what seems to be not only lack
of progress but decided backsliding.[1] It is this which led William
James to quote with approval the aphorism that one learns to skate
in summer and swim in winter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Drill <i>versus</i> attentive repetition in learning.</b> The
rapidity with which habits may be acquired and the permanency with
which they may be retained depend on other factors than simply that
of repetition. Mere mechanical drill is effective in the acquisition
of simple mechanical habits. The most attentive appreciation of
the proper things to be done in playing tennis or the piano will
not by itself make one an expert in those activities. The effective
responses must actually be performed in order that the appropriate
connections within the nervous system may be made, and may become
habitual. <a name="page_31"><span class="page">Page 31</span></a> A
habit is physiologically nothing but a certain set or direction
given to paths in the nervous system. These paths become fixed,
embedded, and ingrained only when nerve currents pass over them
time and time again.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See Ladd and Woodworth: <i>Physiological Psychology</i>,
pp. 542-92.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mere repetition, on the other hand, will not suffice in the acquisition
of complex habits of action. The learning of these requires a deliberate
noting and appreciation of the significant factors in the performance
of an activity, and the consciously chosen repetition of these in
succeeding instances until the habit is well fixed. One reason
why animals cannot be taught so wide a variety of complex habits
as can the human being is that they cannot keep their attention
fixed on successive repetitions, and that in learning they literally
do not know what they are doing. They cannot, as can humans, break
up the activity which they are in process of learning into its
significant factors, and attend to these in successive repetitions.
The superiority of deliberate learning over the brute method of trial
and error consists precisely in that the deliberate and attentive
learner can pick out the important steps of any process, and learn
rapidly to eliminate random and useless features of his early
performances without waiting to have the right way "knocked into
him" by experience. He will short-circuit the process of learning
by choosing appropriate responses in advance, noting how they may
be made more effective and discovering methods for making them so,
and for eliminating useless, random, and ineffective acts. What
we call the "capacity to learn" is evident in marked degree where
there is alert attention to the steps of the process in successive
repetitions. The truth in the assertion that an intelligent man
will shortly outclass the merely automatically skillful in any
occupation or profession requiring training, lies not in any mysterious
faculty, but in the peculiarly valuable habit of attending with
discriminating interest to any process, and learning it thereby
with vastly more economical rapidity. Genius may be more than what
one writer described it, "a painstaking attention to detail"; but a
<a name="page_32"><span class="page">Page 32</span></a> painstaking
attention to the meaning and bearing of details it most decidedly
is.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Learning affected by age, fatigue, and health.</b> There are
certain conditions not altogether within the control of the individual
which affect the rapidity with which habits are acquired. One of the
most important of these is fatigue. Connections among the fibers
that go to make up the nervous system cannot be made with ease
and rapidity when the organism is fatigued. At such times there
seems to be an unusually high resistance at the synapses or nerve
junctions (where there is a lowering of resistance to the passage
of a nerve current when habits are easily formed). After a certain
point of fatigue, whether in the acquisition of motor habits or
the memorizing of information, in which the process is much the
same, the rate of learning is much slower and the degree of accuracy
much less. The length of time through which habits are retained
when acquired during a state of fatigue is also much less than
under a more healthy and resilient condition of the organism.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The point of fatigue varies among different individuals and in
consequence the conditions of habit-formation vary. But some conditions
remain constant. For instance, in experiments with memory tests
(memory being a form of habit in the nervous system), material
memorized in the morning seems to be most rapidly acquired and most
permanently retained.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The age and health of the individual also are important factors
in the capacity to learn, or habit-formation. Conditions during
disease are similar to those obtaining during fatigue, only to a
more acute degree. The toxins and poisons in the nervous system
at such times operate to prevent the formation of new habits and
the breaking of old ones. For while the synapses (nerve junctions)
may offer high resistance to the passage of a new stimulus, they
will lend themselves more and more readily to the passage of stimuli
by which they have already been traversed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_33"><span class="page">Page 33</span></a> That the
age of the individual should make a vast difference in the capacity
to acquire new habits and to modify old ones is obvious from the
physiology of habit already described. When the brain and nervous
system are both young, there are few neural connections established,
and the organism is plastic to all stimuli. As the individual grows
older, connections once made tend to be repeated and to be, as it
were, unconsciously preferred by the nervous system. The capacity
to form habits is most pronounced in the young child in whose nervous
structure no one action rather than another has yet had a chance to
be ingrained. The more connections that are made, the more habits
that are acquired, the less, in a sense, can be made. For the organism
will tend to repeat those actions to which it has previously been
stimulated, and the more frequently it repeats them the more frequently
it will tend to. So that, as William James pointed out, by twenty-five
we are almost literally bundles of habits. When the majority of acts
of life have become routine and fixed, it is almost impossible
to acquire new ways of acting, since the acquisition of new habits
seriously interferes with the old, and old habits physiologically
stay put.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Habit as a time-saver.</b> This fact, that habits can be acquired
most easily early in life, and that those early acquired become so
fixed that they are almost inescapable, is of supreme importance
to the individual and society. It is in one sense a great advantage;
it is an enormous saver of time. In the famous words of James:[1]
</p>

<p class="include">
The great thing, then, in all education, is to <i>make our nervous
system our ally instead of our enemy</i>. It is to fund and capitalize
our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of the fund.
<i>For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible,
as many useful actions as we can</i>, and guard against the growing
into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we would
guard against the plague. The more of the details of our daily
life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism,
the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own
proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in
whom nothing <a name="page_34"><span class="page">Page 34</span></a>
is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every
cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to
bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects
of express volitional deliberation. Full half the time of such a
man goes to the deciding, or regretting, of matters which ought
to be so ingrained in him as practically not to exist for his
consciousness at all. If there be such daily duties not yet ingrained
in any one of my readers, let him begin this very hour to set the
matter right.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. I, p. 122.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The ideal of efficiency is the ideal of having the effective thing
habitually done with as little effort and difficulty as possible.
This in the case of human beings is, as James points out, attained
when good habits are early acquired and when as large a proportion
as possible of purely routine activity is made effortless and below
the level of consciousness. To do as many things as possible without
thinking is to free thinking for new situations. Our experiences
would be very restricted indeed if we could not reduce a large
portion of the things we do to the mechanics of habit. Walking,
eating, these, though partly instinctive, were once problems requiring
thought, effort, and attention. If we had to spend all our lives
learning to dress and undress, to find our way about our own house
or city, to spell and to pronounce correctly, it is clear how little
variety and diversity we should ever attain in our lives. By the
time we are twenty these fundamental habits are so firmly fixed
in us that, for better or for worse, they are ours for life, and
we are free to give our attention to other things. Again in the
words of James:

We all of us have a definite routine manner of performing certain
daily offices connected with the toilet, with the opening and shutting
of familiar cupboards, and the like. Our lower centers know the order
of these movements, and show their knowledge by their "surprise" if
the objects are altered so as to oblige the movement to be made
in a different way. But our higher thought centers know hardly
anything about the matter. Few men can tell off-hand which sock,
shoe, or trousers-leg they put on first. They must first mentally
rehearse the act; and even that is often insufficient&mdash;the
act must be <i>performed</i>. So of the questions, Which valve of
my <a name="page_35"><span class="page">Page 35</span></a> double
door opens first? Which way does my door swing? etc. I cannot
<i>tell</i> the answer; yet my <i>hand</i> never makes a mistake.
No one can <i>describe</i> the order in which he brushes his hair
or teeth; yet it is likely that the order is a pretty fixed one
in all of us.[1]

<b>Habit as a stabilizer of action.</b> Habit not only thus saves
time, but stabilizes action, and where the habits acquired are
effective ones, this is invaluable. Habits of prompt performance of
certain daily duties on the part of the individual are a distinct
benefit both to him and to others, as certain customary efficient
office practices, when they are really habitual, immensely facilitate
the operation of a business. On a larger scale habit is "society's
most precious conservative agent." Individuals not only develop
personal habits of dress, speech, etc., but become habituated to
social institutions, to certain occupations, to the prestige attaching
to some types of action and the punishment correlated with others.
Education in the broadest sense is simply the acquisition of those
habits which adapt an individual to his social environment. It is
the instrument society uses to hand down the habits of thinking,
feeling, and action which characterize a civilization. Society is
protected from murder, theft, and pillage by law and the police,
but it is even better protected by the fact that living together
peacefully and co&ouml;peratively is for most adults habitual. In
a positive sense the multifarious occupations and professions of
a great modern city are carried on from day to day in all their
accustomed detail, not because the lawyers, the business men, the
teachers, who practice them continuously reason them out, nor from
continuous instinctive promptings. They are striking testimony
to the influence of habit. As a recent English writer puts it:
</p>

<p class="include">
The population of London would be starved in a week if the flywheel
of habit were removed, if no signalman or clerk or policeman ever
did anything which was not suggested by a first-hand impulse, or
if no one were more honest or punctual or industrious than he was
led to be by his conscious love, on that particular day, for his
master <a name="page_36"><span class="page">Page 36</span></a> or
for his work, or by his religion, or by a conviction of danger
from the criminal law.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
From etiquette and social distinction, from formalities of conversation
and correspondence, of greeting and farewell, of condolence and
congratulation to the most important "customs of the country,"
with respect to marriage, property, and the like, ways of acting
are maintained by the mechanism of habit rather than by arbitrary
law or equally arbitrary instinctive caprice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Disserviceable habits in the individual.</b> Habitual behavior
which can become so completely controlling in the lives of so many
people is not without its dangers. The nervous system is originally
neutral, and can be involved on the side either of good or evil.
A human born with a plastic brain and nervous system must acquire
habits, but that he will acquire good habits (that is, habits
serviceable to his own happiness and to that of his fellows) is
not guaranteed by nature. Habits are indeed more notorious than
famous, and examples are more frequently chosen from evil ones
than from good. Promptness in the performance of one's professional
or domestic duties, care in speech, in dress and in demeanor, are,
once they are acquired, permanent assets. But if these fail to be
developed, dishonesty or superficiality, slovenliness in dress
and speech, and surliness in manner, may and do become equally
habitual. The significance of this has been eloquently stated at
the close of James's famous discussion:
</p>

<p class="include">
The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no
worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually
fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young but
realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits,
they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic
state. We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to
be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its
never-so-little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's
play, excuses himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, "I
won't count this time!" Well, he may not count it, and a kind Heaven
may not <a name="page_37"><span class="page">Page 37</span></a>
count it, but it is being counted none the less. Down among his
nerve cells and fibres, the molecules are counting it, registering
and storing it up to be used against him when the next temptation
comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literalness,
wiped out.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. I, p. 127.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Social inertia.</b> If the acquisition of bad, that is,
disserviceable habits, is disastrous to the individual, it is in
some respects even worse in the group. The inertia of the nervous
system, the tendency to go on repeating connections that have once been
made is one of the strongest obstacles to change, however desirable.
It is not only that habits of action have been established, but
that with them go deep-seated habits of thought and feeling. The
repression of people's accustomed ways of doing things may bring with
it a sense of frustration almost as complete and painful as if these
obstructed activities were instinctive. This is not true merely in
the melodramatic instances of drug addicts and drunkards. It is true
in the case of social habits which have become established in a large
group. Any Utopian that dreams of revolutionizing society overnight
fails to take into account the enormous control of habits over
groups which have acquired them, and the powerful emotions, amounting
sometimes to passion, which are aroused by their frustration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The importance of the learning habit.</b> That habit is at once
the conserver and the petrifier of society has long been recognized
by social philosophers. There is one habit, however, the acquisition
of which is itself a preventive of the complete domination of the
individual or the group by hard and fast routine. This is the habit
of learning, which is necessary to the acquisition of any habits at
all. Man in learning new habits, "learns to learn." This ability
to learn is, of course, correlated with a plasticity of brain and
nerve fiber which is most present in early youth. The disappearance
of this capacity is hastened by the pressure which forces individuals
in their business and professional life to cling fast to certain
habits which are prized and rewarded by the group. A sedulous <a
name="page_38"><span class="page">Page 38</span></a> cultivation
on the part of the individual of the habit of open-minded inquiry,
of the habit of learning, and the encouragement of this tendency
by the group are the only antidotes that can be provided against
this marked physiological tendency to fossilization and the frequent
social tendencies in the same direction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Whether habits shall master us, or whether we shall be their masters,
depends also on the method by which they were acquired. If they were
learned merely through mechanical drill, they will be fixed and
rigid. If they were learned deliberately to meet new situations,
they will not be retained when the conditions they were acquired
to meet are utterly changed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The specificity of habits.</b> One important consideration,
finally, that must be brought to consideration is that habits are,
like instincts, specific. They are not general "open sesames" which,
learned in one situation, will apply with indiscriminate miraculousness
to a variety of others. Just as an instinct is a definite response
to a definite stimulus, so is a habit. The chief and almost only
observable difference is that the former is unlearned, while the
latter is learned or acquired.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while habits are specific, they are within limits transferable. Such
is the case when a situation which calls out a certain habitual response
is paralleled in significant points by another. Thus the situation,
one's - room - at - home - cluttered - up - with - a - miscellany - of -
books - papers - tennis - apparatus - and - clothing, has sufficiently
similar significant points to the situation, one's - office - littered -
with - documents - old - letters - manuscripts - blueprints - and - proofs,
to call forth, if the habit has been established in one case, the identical
response of "tidying up" in the other. But unless there are marked points
of similarity between two different sets of circumstances, specific habits
remain specific and non-transferable. There is in the laws of habit no
guarantee that an industrious application to the batting averages of
the major league on the part of an
<a name="page_39"><span class="page">Page 39</span></a>
alert twelve-year-old will provoke the same assiduous assimilation
of the facts of the American Revolution; that a boy who works hard
at his chemistry will work equally hard at his English, or that
one who is careful about his manners and pronunciation in school
will display the slightest heed to them among his companions on the
ball-field. One of the most cogent arguments against the stereotyped
teaching of Latin and Greek has been the serious doubt psychologists
have held as to whether four years' training in Latin syntax will
develop in the student general mental habits which will be applicable
or useful outside the Latin classroom.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The older "faculty" psychologists presumed that different subjects
trained various so-called "faculties" of "memory," "imagination,"
and "intellect." It has now become clear on experimental evidence
that in education we are training no isolated faculties, but are
training the individual to certain specific habits. The more widely
applicable the habits are, obviously the more valuable or dangerous
will they be in the conduct of life. But when habits do become
general, such as a habit of promptness, honesty, and regularity, not
in one situation but "in general," it is because they are something
more than habits in the strict physiological sense. They are
intellectual as well as merely motor in character; they are deliberate
and conscious methods rather than mechanical rules of thumb. Habits
that have been drilled into an individual will appear only when the
situation very closely approximates the one in which the drill has
been performed. The cat that has learned to get out of a certain
type of cage by pressing a button will be utterly at a loss if the
familiar features of the cage are changed. The intelligent human
will detect and take pains to detect among the minor differences of
the situation some significant fact which he has met in another
setting, and he will apply a habit useful in this new situation
despite the slightly changed accompanying circumstances. The man
who can drive an automobile with reflective appreciation of the
processes involved, who knows, as <a name="page_40"><span
class="page">Page 40</span></a> we say, what he is doing, will
not long be baffled by a car with a slightly different arrangement
of levers and steering-gear, nor be completely frustrated when the
car for some reason fails to move. As happened in many notable
instances during the World War, trained executives were not long
at a loss when they shifted from the management of a steel plant
to a shipyard, or from large-scale mining operations in Montana
to large-scale relief work in Belgium.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The conscious transference of habits.</b> When habits are consciously
acquired, they may be consciously transferred with modifications
to situations slightly different from those in which they were
first learned. Merely mechanical habits are a hindrance in any
save the most mechanical work. An alert and conscious method of
learning, which means the development of habits <i>as</i> methods
of control, will enable the individual to modify habits acquired
in slightly different circumstances to new situations where the
major conditions remain the same. To be merely habitual is to be
at best an efficient machine, utterly unable to do anything except
to run along certain grooves, to respond like an animal trained to
certain tricks. It means, moreover, a loss of richness in experience.
When a profession becomes routinated it becomes meaningless; a mere
making of the wheels go round. The spirit of alert and conscious
inquiry must be maintained if life is not to become a mere repeated
monotony.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An alert and conscious adjustment of habits to a changing environment
constitutes intelligence. The technique of this adjustment is the
technique of thinking or of reflective behavior, which we shall
examine in more detail in the following chapter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Emotion.</b> All human action, whether on the plane of instinct,
habit, or reflection, is, to a lesser or greater degree, accompanied
by emotion. While there is considerable controversy among psychologists
as to the precise nature of emotion, and the precise conditions of
its causation, its general features and significance are fairly
clear. Emotion may be <a name="page_41"><span class="page">Page
41</span></a> most generally defined as an awareness or consciousness
on the part of the individual of his experiences, both those in
which he is the actor and those in which he is being passively acted
upon. This awareness or consciousness is not detached intellectual
perception, but is accompanied by, as it is by some held to be merely
the consciousness of, certain specific bodily disturbances. Thus the
emotions of fear and grief are not cold and abstract perceptions
of situations that belong in the classes dangerous or deplorable,
respectively. The awareness of these situations by the individual
is intimately and invariably connected with certain outward bodily
manifestations and certain inner organic disturbances. Fear, rage,
pity, and the like are not unimpassioned judgments, but highly
charged physical changes. So close, indeed, is the connection between
specific bodily conditions and the subjective or inner consciousness
that we call emotion, that James and Lange simultaneously came
to the conclusion that emotions are nothing more nor less than
the blending of the complex organic changes that occur in any given
emotional state. Thus James:
</p>

<p class="include">
What kind of an emotion of fear would be left if the feeling neither
of quickened heart-beats nor of shallow breathing, neither of trembling
lips nor of weakened limbs, neither of goose-flesh nor of visceral
stirrings, were present, it is impossible for me to think. Can anyone
fancy the state of rage, and picture no ebullition in the chest, no
flushing of the face, no dilation of the nostrils, no clenching of
the teeth, no impulse to vigorous action, but in their stead limp
muscles, calm breathing, and a placid face? The present writer,
for one, certainly cannot. The rage is as completely evaporated
as the sensations of its so-called manifestations, and the only
thing that can possibly be supposed to take its place is some cold
blooded and dispassionate judicial sentence, confined entirely
to the intellectual realm, to the effect that a certain person
or persons merit chastisement for their sins. In like manner of
grief; what would it be without its tears, its sobs, its suffocation
of the heart, its pang in the breast-bone? A feelingless cognition
that certain circumstances are deplorable, and nothing more.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. II, p. 452.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_42"><span class="page">Page 42</span></a> Indeed,
so completely did James think the emotions were explicable as the
inner feeling of the complex organic sensations which go to make
up each of them that he did not think it misleading to say "we
feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because
we tremble; we do not cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry,
angry, or fearful, as the case may be."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Whether or not emotions are completely to be explained as the inner
or subjective aspect of the complex of organic disturbances which
accompany fear, rage, and the like, and which are caused immediately
by the perception of the appropriate objects of these emotions, it
is certainly true that emotional awareness and bodily disturbances
are very closely connected.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Recent experiments by Dr. Cannon at Harvard have shown
the specific bodily disturbances which accompany anger, fear, etc. In
particular, Dr. Cannon, and others, have noted that in the emotional
conditions of fear and anger the glands, located near the kidneys,
discharge a fluid into the blood stream, which fluid stimulates the
heart to activity, constricts the blood vessels of the internal
organs, causes the liver to pour out into the blood its stores of
sugar, and affects in one way or another all the organs of the body.
The general effect is to put the body into a state of preparedness
for the activities connected with the emotion, whether flight in
the case of fear, attack as in the case of anger. This has led
Professor Woodworth to define emotion as, at least in part, "the
way the body feels when it is prepared for a certain reaction."
See the latter's <i>Dynamic Psychology</i>, pp. 51-59.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Various attempts have been made to classify the emotions which are,
in ordinary experience, infinitely subtle and complex. The subtlety
and variety of emotion James explains as the result of the subtle and
imperceptible differences in the complex of sensations which occur
in any given situation. In general, it has been recognized that the
emotions are very closely connected with the primary tendencies of
man. McDougall, for example, says that each of the great primary
impulses is accompanied by an emotion. Indeed, McDougall considers,
as earlier noted, that the emotion is the affective or conscious
aspect of an instinct which, at the same time, has a perceptual and
impulsive aspect; that, in the case of fear, the perceptual aspect
is the instinctive mechanism for recognizing <a name="page_43"><span
class="page">Page 43</span></a> objects of danger, the impulsive
aspect is the tendency toward flight, and the affective aspect is
the inner feeling or awareness of fear. Thus, for McDougall, the
tender emotion is the emotional aspect of the instinct of pity,
anger of the instinct of pugnacity, which is, as an impulse, the
tendency to strike and destroy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As a matter of fact, as McDougall himself admits, emotions are
seldom experienced in unmixed forms, and it is very difficult to
reduce the infinite variety of emotional experiences to any primary
forms. One may well agree with James that "subdivisions [in the
psychological demarcation of the emotions] are to a great extent
either fictitious or unimportant, and ... pretenses to accuracy, a
sham." In general, one may say that emotions are closely connected
with the native tendencies of human beings and are aroused by both
their fulfillment, their conflict, and their frustration. The variety
of emotions results from the fact that no single one of our instincts
is stimulated at a time, and that the peculiar specific quality of
each emotional experience is due to the specific point of conflict,
fulfillment, or frustration in each particular case. It may be
further noted that those emotions are, in general, pleasantly toned
which accompany the fulfillment or the approach to the fulfillment
of a native disposition; and those are unpleasantly toned which
accompany their frustration or conflict. The depth and intensity of
the emotional disturbance seem to depend on the degree and extent to
which strong instinctive or habitual impulses have become involved.
For as habits of action may be acquired, so also may emotions become
associated habitually with them. The emotional disturbances connected
with the fulfillment, frustration, and conflict of habits may be
just as intense as those connected with similar phenomena in the
case of instincts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In one sense these emotional disturbances impede action, certainly
action on the reflective level. It is the capacity and function
of reflection to solve and adjust precisely those conflicts of
competing impulses during which emotional disturbances <a
name="page_44"><span class="page">Page 44</span></a> occur. But
the reflective process is confused and distorted in conflicts of
native or habitual desires by these emotional disturbances which
accompany them. It is proverbially difficult to think straight
when angry; the surgeon in performing an operation must not be
moved by pity or fear; and love is notoriously blind. The facts
with which reflection must deal are presented in distorted and
exaggerated form under the stress of competing impulses. Stimuli
become loaded with emotional associations. They are glaring and
conspicuous on the basis of their emotional urgency rather than on
the ground of their logical significance. The paralysis or complete
disorganization of action which occurs in extreme cases of hysteria
takes place to some extent in all less extreme instances of emotional
disturbances.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Emotions, on the other hand, serve to sustain, and, in their less
violent form, to facilitate action. It has already been noted that
the organic disturbances which are so conspicuous a feature of emotion
are extremely important in preparing the body for the overt actions in
which these emotions always tend to issue. And it is unquestionable
that emotions, though in more or less obscure ways, call up reserves
of energy in the service of the activity in connection with which
the emotion has been aroused. While very violent emotions, as in
the case of extreme anger or fear or pity, confuse, disorganize,
and even paralyze action, in more moderate form they rather serve
to stimulate and reinforce it. Emotions are, in many cases, merely
the inner or subjective awareness of one of these great driving
forces, or a complex of them. Anger, pity, and fear, in their less
extreme forms, pour floods of energy into the activities in which
they take overt expression. It needs no special knowledge to recognize
the fact that the normal interests and enterprises of life are
quickened and sustained when some great emotional drive can be roused
in their support. Ambition, loyalty, love, or hate may stir men to
and sustain them in long and difficult enterprises which they would
neither undertake nor continue were these <a name="page_45"><span
class="page">Page 45</span></a> motive forces removed. The soldier
does not fight persistently and well wholly, or often even in part,
because he has thought out the situation and found the cause of his
country to be just. He is stirred and sustained by the energies
which the emotional complex called "patriotism" has roused and
concentrated toward action. A scientist performing long and difficult
researches, a father sacrificing rest and comfort that his children
may be well provided for, a boy working to pay his way through
college, are all persisting in courses of action, because of the
driving power which the emotions, more or less mixed, of curiosity,
or tenderness, or self-assertion have released.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But just as the original nature with which man is born is modifiable,
so are his emotional reactions. Each individual's emotional reactions
are peculiar and specific, because of the particular contacts to
which they have been exposed, and the organization of instincts and
habits which have come to be their more or less fixed character.
Any emotional experience consists of an intermingling of many and
diverse feelings. And these particular complexes of emotions become
for each individual organized about particular persons or objects or
situations. The emotional reactions of an individual are, indeed,
accurately symptomatic of the character of the individual and the
culture of his time. They are aroused, it goes without saying,
on very different occasions and by very different objects, among
different men and different groups. In the sixteenth century pious
persons could watch heretics being burned in oil with a sense of
deep religious exaltation. Certain Fijian tribes slaughter their
aged parents with the most tender filial devotion. In certain savage
communities, to eat in public arouses on the part of the individual
a sense of acute shame.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since those emotions are, on the whole, pleasantly toned which
accompany the fulfillment of instinctive and habitual impulses,
and those unpleasantly toned which accompany their frustration, it
becomes, as Aristotle pointed out, of the <a name="page_46"><span
class="page">Page 46</span></a> most "serious importance" early to
habituate men to the performance of socially useful actions. If
good or useful actions are early made habitual, their performance
will bring pleasure, and will thereby be better insured than by
any amount of preaching or punishment. If the actions which the
group approves are not early made habitual in the younger members
of the group, they will not be enforced either through logic or
electrocution. It is not enough to give people reasons for doing
good, they will only do it consistently if the opposite arouses in
them more or less abhorrence. People learn to modify their actions
on the basis of the pleasure or pain they find in their performance,
and the pleasure or pain they will experience depends on the actions
to which they are habituated and the emotions which have come to
be their characteristic accompaniments.

CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subtitle">REFLECTION.</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Instinct and habit <i>versus</i> reflection.</b> In the two
types of behavior already discussed, man is, as it were, "pushed
from behind." In the case of instinct he performs an action simply
because he <i>must</i> perform it. Willy-nilly he withdraws his hand
from fire, eats when hungry, and sleeps when tired. In the case
of habits, once they are acquired, he is also largely dominated by
circumstances beyond his own control. The bottle is to the confirmed
drunkard almost an irresistible command to drink, the alarm clock to
one accustomed to it an equally imperative and not-to-be-disregarded
order to arise. The story of the old veteran who was carrying home
his dinner and who dropped his hands to his side and his dinner to
the gutter when a practical joker called "Attention"; the pathetic
plight of the superannuated business man who is totally at a loss
away from his familiar duties, are often quoted illustrations of
how completely habit may determine a man's actions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while in a large portion of our daily duties we are thus at
the beck and call of the instincts which are our inheritance and
the habits which we have acquired, we may also <i>control</i> our
actions. Instead of performing actions as immediate and automatic
responses to accustomed stimuli, we may determine our actions,
single or consecutive, in the light of absent and future results.
To act thus is to act reflectively, and to act reflectively is
the only escape from random acts prompted by instinct and routine
ones prompted by habit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To act reflectively is to delay response to an instinctive or habitual
stimulus until the various possibilities of action and the results
associated with each have been considered. An action performed
instinctively or habitually is automatic; it is performed not on
the basis of what will be the result, but <a name="page_48"><span
class="page">Page 48</span></a> simply as an immediate response to
a present stimulus. But an act (or a series of acts) reflectively
performed is performed in the light of the results that are
prophetically associated with them. In the case of instinct and
habit, the individual almost literally does not know what he is
about. In reflective activity he does know, and the more thorough the
reflective process, the more thorough and precise is his knowledge.
He performs actions <i>because</i> they will achieve certain results,
and he is conscious of that causal connection, both before the
action is performed when he perceives the results imaginatively,
and after it is performed when he sees them in fact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The origin and nature of reflection.</b> Reflection, it must
be noted in the first place, is not a thing, but a process. It is
a process whereby human beings adjust themselves to a continuously
changing environment. Our instincts and habits suffice to adapt us
to that large number of recurrent similar situations of which our
experience in no small measure exists. In such cases the habitual
response will bring the usual satisfaction. Walking, dressing,
getting to familiar places, finding the electric button in well-known
rooms, opening often-opened combinations&mdash;these operations are
all adequately accomplished by the fixed mechanisms of habit. But
we meet as frequently with novel situations where the accustomed
or instinctive reactions will not bring the desired satisfaction.
One response or a number of responses will not adjust the individual
satisfactorily to external conditions; or there may be a conflict
between a number of impulses all clamoring for satisfaction at
once. Reflection thus begins either in a maladjustment between
the individual and his environment or in a conflict of impulses
within the same person.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where such a maladjustment occurs, the uneasiness, discomfort, and
frustration of action may be removed in one of two ways. Adjustment
may be achieved, as we have already seen, through physical trial and
error, through a hit-and-miss experimentation with every possible
response until the appropriate <a name="page_49"><span class="page">Page
49</span></a> one is made. This is the only way in which animals
can learn to modify their instinctive tendencies into habits more
adequate to their conditions. The more economical and effective
process, one peculiar to human beings, is that of reflection. To
think or to reflect means to postpone response to a given problematic
situation until the possible consequences of the possible responses
have been mentally traced out. Instead of <i>actually</i> making every
response that occurs to us, we make all of them <i>imaginatively</i>.
Instead of consuming time and energy in physical trial and error,
we go through the process of mental trial and error. We make no
response at all in action until we have surveyed all the possibilities
of action and their possible consequences. And when we do make a
response we make it on the basis of those foreseen consequences.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The possibilities of response that do occur to us are,
on the whole, determined by past training and native differences
in temperament. But part of the process of reflection is, as we shall
see in the chapter on "Science and Scientific Method," concerned
with deliberately enlarging the field of possible responses in the
solution of a given problem.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In other words, the situation is analyzed. What is the end or adjustment
sought, what are the possible responses, and how far is each of them
suited as a means to achieving the satisfaction sought? Instead of
going through every random course of action that suggests itself,
each one is "dramatically rehearsed." Finally, that response is made
which gives most promise in terms of its prophesied consequences
of adjusting us to our situation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Illustration of the reflective process.</b> A student may, for
example, be seated at his study, preparing for an examination. A
friend enters and suggests going for a walk or to the theater. If
the student were to follow this first immediate impulse he would,
before he realized it, be off for an evening's entertainment. But
instead of responding immediately, dropping his books, reaching
for his hat, opening the door, and ringing for the elevator (a
series of habitual acts initiated by the instinctive desire for
rest, variety, and companionship), <a name="page_50"><span
class="page">Page 50</span></a> he may rehearse in imagination the
various possibilities of action. In general terms, what happens
is simply this:[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The technique of reflection will be discussed in detail
in the chapter on "Science and Scientific Method."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the one hand, the gregarious instinct, the desire for rest,
native curiosity, and an acquired interest in drama may prompt
him strongly to go to the theater. On the other hand, the habits
of industry, ambition, self-assertion, and studying in the evening
urge him to stay at home and study. The first course of action may,
for the moment, be immediately attractive and stimulating. But
instead of responding to either immediately, the student rehearses
dramatically the possibilities associated with each. On the one
hand are the immediate satisfactions of rest, amusement, and
companionship. But as further consequences of the impulse to go out
to the theater are seen&mdash;or, rather, are foreseen&mdash;failure
in the examination, the loss of a scholarship, pain to one's family
or friends, and chagrin at the frustration of one's deepest and
most permanent ideals. The second course of action, to stay at
home and study, though it is seen to have connected with it certain
immediate privations, is foreseen to involve the further consequences
of passing the examination, keeping one's scholarship, and maintaining
certain personal or intellectual standards one has set one's self.
Even if the student decides to follow the first course of action to
which an immediate impulse has prompted him, his act is different
in quality from what it would have been if he had not reflected
at all. The student goes out fully aware of the consequences of
what he is doing; he goes <i>for</i> the immediate pleasure and
<i>in spite of</i> the possible failure in the examination. The very
heart of reflective behavior is thus seen to lie in the fact that
present stimuli are reacted to, not for what they are as immediate
stimuli, but for what they signify, portend, imply, in the way of
consequences or results. And a response made upon reflection is
made on the basis of these imaginatively realized consequences.
We connect what we do with the results that <a name="page_51"><span
class="page">Page 51</span></a> flow from the doing, and control
our action in the light of that prophetically realized connection.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The process is obviously not always so simple as that described in
the above illustration. In the first place, more than two courses
of action may suggest themselves. And the consequences of any one of
them may be far more complex and far more obscure than any suggested
in the above. For an individual to be able to decide a problem
on the basis of consequences imaginatively foreseen, it is often
necessary to institute a very elaborate system of connecting links
between an immediately suggested course of action and its not at
all obvious results. "Thinking a thing out" involves precisely
this introduction of connecting links, or "middle terms," between
what is immediately given or suggested and what necessarily, though
by no means obviously, follows. This is illustrated in the case of
any more or less theoretical problem and its solution. To perceive,
for example, the connection between atmospheric pressure and the rise
of water in a suction pump involves the introduction of connecting
links in the form of the general law of gravitation, of which
atmospheric pressure is a special case.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the same is true of practical problems. A young man may be trying
to decide whether or not to take a nomination to the training course
at West Point. He may be attracted by the four years' training, and
highly value the results of it. He may think, however, that the
training involves an obligation to serve in the army; it may mean,
for a long time, service in some remote army post. His decision may
be determined by this last consideration, which required a series
of intermediate "linking" ideas to bring to light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The technique of scientific or expert thinking is, in large part,
concerned with devices for enabling the thinker more securely to
trace the obscure and remote connections between actions and their
consequences, between causes and effects. But, whether simple or
complex, the essential feature of reflective activity is that it
is action performed in the light of <a name="page_52"><span
class="page">Page 52</span></a> consequences foreseen in imagination.
Physical stimuli are not responded to immediately with physical
action. They are responded to as symbols, signs, or portents; they
are taken as symptoms of the results that <i>would</i> follow if
they <i>were</i> acted upon. That is, they are, until decision is
made, reacted to imaginatively. When an actual response is finally
made, it is made on the basis of the results that have been more
or less accurately and directly anticipated in imagination.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflection as the modifier of instinct.</b> Reflection is primarily
a revealer of consequences. Instead of yielding to the first impulse
that occurs to him, the thinking man considers where that impulse,
if followed out, will lead. And since man is moved by more than
one impulse at a time, reflection traces the consequences of each,
and determines action on the basis of the relative satisfactions it
can prophesy after careful inquiry into the situation. To reflect
is primarily to query a stimulus, to find out what it means in
terms of its consequences. The more alert, persistent, and careful
this inquiry, the more will instinctive tendencies be checked and
modified and adjusted to new situations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the discussion of the acquisition of habits, it was pointed out
that useful habits may be acquired most rapidly by an analysis of
them into their significant features. The speed with which random
instinctive actions are modified into a series of useful habitual ones
depends intimately upon how clear and detailed is the individual's
appreciation of the results to be achieved by one action rather than
another. A large part of learning even among humans is doubtless
trial and error, random hit-or-miss attempts, until after successive
repetitions, a successful response is made and retained. But human
learning and habit-formation are so much more various and fruitful
than those of animals precisely because human beings can check and
modify instinctive responses in the light of consequences which
they can foresee. These foreseen consequences are, of course, derived
from previous experience; <a name="page_53"><span class="page">Page
53</span></a> that is, they are "remembered." But reflection
short-circuits the process. The more deliberate and reflective the
process of learning, the more the individual notes the connections
between the things he does and the results he gets, the fewer
repetitions will he need in order effectively to modify his instinctive
behavior into useful habits. He will anticipate results; he will
experience them in imagination. He will not need to make every
wrong move in paddling a canoe until he finally hits upon the right
one. He will not need to alienate all his clients before learning to
deal with them successfully. In any given set of circumstances he
will form the effective habits rapidly. He will calculate, "figure
out," find out in advance. To keep one's temper under provocation,
to refrain from eating delicious and indigestible foods, to keep
at work when one would like to play, and sometimes to play when
one is engrossed in work, are familiar instances of how our first
impulses become checked, restrained, or modified in the light of
the results we have discovered to be associated with them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflective behavior modifies habit.</b> The same conscious
breaking-up of a new type of action into its significant features,
the same connection of a given action with a given result which
makes the intelligent learner so much more quickly acquire effective
new habits than the one who is mechanically drilled, leads also to
a continuous criticism of habits, and their discontinuance when
they are no longer adequate. Reflection, if it is itself a habit,
is the most valuable one of all. It is an important counterpoise
to the hardening and fossilization which repeated habitual actions
bring about in the nervous system.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In acting reflectively we subject our accustomed ways to deliberate
analysis, however immediately persuasive these may have become,
and deliberately institute new habits in the light of the more
desirable consequences they will bring. Habits come to be regarded
not as final or as good in themselves, <a name="page_54"><span
class="page">Page 54</span></a> but as methods of accomplishing
good. If they fail to bring genuine satisfaction, reflection can
indicate wherein they are inadequate, wherein they may be changed,
and whether they should be altogether discarded.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reflection thus makes conduct conscious; it is not the substitute
for instinct and habit; it is the guide and controller of both.
When we act thoughtfully and intelligently, we are doing things
not because we have done them that way in the past, or because
it is the first response that occurs to us, but because, in the
light of analysis, that way will bring about the most desirable
results.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The limits of reflection as a modifier of instinct and habit.</b>
While our impulses and habits may be subjected to the criticism of
reflection in the light of the consequences which it can forecast,
reflection is itself seriously limited by our original impulses and
our acquired habitual ones. On reflection, we may not follow our first
impulse, but to act at all is to act on some original or acquired
impulse or a combination of them. Which original tendency we shall
follow reflection can tell us; it cannot tell us to follow none.
In the illustration already used, the student may upon reflection
study rather than go out. But the roots of his studying will also
lie back in the instincts and habits which are, for better or for
worse, his only equipment for action. They will lie back in the
tendencies to be curious, to gain the praise of other people and to
be a leader among them, in the habits of knowing work thoroughly,
of studying in the evening, of maintaining a scholarship average
to which he has been accustomed. Reflection may weigh the relative
persuasions of various impulses; it cannot ignore them. We may
think in order to attain our desires, and may, through reflection,
learn to change them; we cannot abolish them. Whether we are curious
about our neighbors' business or about the movements of the stars
and the possible reactions of a strange chemical element, depends
on our previous training and the extent to which inquiry itself
has become a fixed and persistent habit. But in any case we are
curious. Whether we <a name="page_55"><span class="page">Page
55</span></a> fight in street brawls or in campaigns against
tuberculosis, we are still, as it were, born fighters.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Similarly, in the case of habit, we may upon reflection discover
that our habits of walking, writing, or speech are bad; that we
ought not to smoke, or drink, or waste time. We may come, through
reflection, to realize with the utmost clarity the advantages to
ourselves of acquiring the habits of going to bed early, saving
money, keeping our papers in order, and persisting at work amid
distractions. But the bad habits and the good are already fixed
in our nervous system, and in physiology also possession is nine
tenths of the law. We may <i>intend</i> to change, but by taking
thought alone we cannot add a cubit to our stature. Reflection can
do no more than point the way we should go. For unless the wrong
actions are systematically and repeatedly refrained from, and the
proper ones made habitual, thinking remains merely an impotent summary
of what can be done. Conduct is governed, it must be repeated, by
the satisfactions action can bring us, and unless actions are made
habitual they will not be performed with satisfaction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>How instincts and habits impair the processes of reflection.</b>
It is as important as it is paradoxical that thinking is impaired
in its efficiency by the instincts and habits in whose service it
arises, and whose conflicts and maladjustments it helps to resolve.
The situations of conflict or perplexity which provoke thinking
are determined by the particular tendencies which, by nature or
training, are brought into play in any given situation. If we are
committed by tradition or habitual allegiance to a protective tariff,
we will be concerned in our thinking with details, what articles
need protection and how much do they need; the ultimate desirability
of a protective tariff will not be a problem remotely occurring
to us. If we are by training committed to capital punishment, we
will be concerned, if we think about it at all, with means and
methods; we will think about the relative merits of hanging or
electrocution; the ultimate justification or desirability of capital
<a name="page_56"><span class="page">Page 56</span></a> punishment
will not be a problem or issue for us at all. Thus, it may be said
in a sense that our thinking is determined by what we do not think
about as much as by what we do think about. What we take for granted
limits the field within which we will inquire or reflect at all. But
what we take for granted is, on the whole, settled by our habitual
reactions. And the more settled habitual convictions we have, the
narrower becomes the field within which reflection takes place.
Force of habit may leave us blind to many situations genuinely
demanding solution. Originality in thinking consists, in part at
least, in an ability to see a problem where others, through routine,
see none. Apples have fallen on the heads of others than Newton,
but a habit-ridden rustic will not be stirred by the falling of an
apple to reflection on the problem of falling bodies. The countryman
may live all his life serenely oblivious to a thousand problems
that would pique the curiosity and reflection of a botanist or
geologist. A man may go on for years accepting income on investments
earned in very dubious ways without ever pausing to reflect on
the sources or the justification of his wealth.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: According to the traditional anecdote, when Marie
Antoinette was told that the people were clamoring because they
could not get any bread, the one problem that occurred to her was
why they didn't eat cake. From the habits and conditions of life
to which she was accustomed, there had never arisen a problem as
to how to get food at all; it was merely a problem of what kind
of food to eat.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Instincts and habits, furthermore, limit the field of possible
courses of action that suggest themselves. We come, through habit,
to be alive only to certain possibilities to the practical exclusion
of all others. Thinking becomes fruitful and suggestive when it is
freed from the limited number of suggestions that occur through force
of habit. But original thinking is rare precisely because habits do
have such a compulsive power in determining the possibilities of
action that suggest themselves to us. The man who moves in a rut
of habitual reactions will "never think" of possibilities that
"stare in the face" a less habit-ridden thinker. Inventiveness,
originality, <a name="page_57"><span class="page">Page 57</span></a>
creative intelligence, whatever one chooses to call it, consists,
in no small measure, in this ability to remain alive to a wide
variety of stimuli, to keep sensitive to all the possibilities
that are in a situation, instead of those only to which we are
immediately prompted by instinct or habit. The possibility of using
the current of a river as power is not the first possibility that
flowing water suggests.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Past training and individual differences in temperament not only
limit the possibilities that do occur to us; they seriously distort,
color, and qualify those of which we become conscious. We forecast
differently and with differing degrees of accuracy the consequences
of those possible courses of action which do occur to us according
to the influence and stimulation which particular native traits and
acquired impulses have in our conduct. Ideally, the consequences
which we imaginatively forecast as following from a given course of
action, should tally with the consequences which genuinely follow
from it. But there is too often a sad discrepancy between the
consequences as they are foreseen by the individual concerned and
the genuine consequences that could be foreseen by any disinterested
observer. The discrepancy between the genuine and the imagined
consequences of given ideas or suggestions is caused more than
anything else by the hopes, fears, aversions, and preferences which,
by nature or training, are controlling in a man's behavior. Facts
are weighed differently according as one or another of these
psychological influences is present. We intend unconsciously to
substitute a desired or expected consequence for the actual one;
we tend to be oblivious to consequences which we fear, and quick
to imagine those for which we hope. On the day before an election
the campaign managers on both sides, in the glow and momentum of
their activities, are confident of the morrow's victory. The opponent
of prohibition saw nothing but drug fiends and revolution as its
consequences; its extreme advocates saw it as the salvation of
mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The causes of error in appraising the consequences of any <a
name="page_58"><span class="page">Page 58</span></a> given course
of action are partly individual and partly social in character. From
Francis Bacon down, there have been various attempts to classify these
factors in the distortion of the reflective process. In connection
with the particular human traits, especially such as fear and
gregariousness, we shall have occasion to examine a few of these.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It will suffice to point out here that the aim of reflective thinking
is to discover the genuine consequences of things, and to eliminate
and discount those prejudices and preferences, bred of early education
and training, which might impair our discovery of those consequences.
To the untrained, those things look most significant which stir their
impulses most strikingly. The beggar's sores seem much more important
and terrible than a gifted youngster deprived of education through
poverty. Instinctively we shrink back from the sight of blood, but
instinct is no safe clue in helping us to distinguish between the
poisons and the panaceas among the brightly colored bottles of
chemicals ranged along a shelf. The whole technique of scientific
method as opposed to the shrewd but unreliable guesses of common
sense is one of freeing us from the compulsions of random habitual
impulses. It substitutes for caprice the measuring of consequences,
the detailed knowing of what we are about. That impartial judgment
has its difficulties is clear from the simple fact alone that human
beings start by being a bundle of instincts and soon grow into
a bundle of habits. To the extent to which they can control these
they are masters of themselves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The value of reflection for life.</b> To many people there is
something terrifying about the idea of controlling life by reason.
Life (they point out correctly) is a vital process of instincts
which appear before thinking, and which are often more powerful
than reasoned judgments. Against advice to live consciously, to
be in control of ourselves, to know what we are about, comes the
call "Back to Nature." A life of reflection appears chilling and
arbitrary. Because reflection so often reveals that impulses must
be checked if disaster <a name="page_59"><span class="page">Page
59</span></a> is not to result, it has come to be associated with
a metallic and Stoic repression. To many a persuasive impulse we
must, after reflection, say, "No." Because of this a certain school
of philosophers, poets, and radicals urges us to trust nature, to
follow our impulses, which, being natural, must be right.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All of these rebels against reason make the mistake of supposing
that the aim of reflective thinking is to quell instincts, which,
with the best will in the world, it cannot succeed in doing. Instincts
are present and powerful. In themselves they are neither worth
encouraging, nor ought they to be repressed. The satisfaction of
native desires <i>is</i> what we want. The importance of reflective
thinking is precisely that it helps us to secure those satisfactions.
To surrender to every random impulse or every habitual prompting
is to have neither satisfaction nor freedom. Reflection might be
compared to the traffic policeman at the junction of two crowded
thoroughfares. If everyone were to drive his car pell-mell through
the rush, if pedestrians, street cars, and automobiles were not
to abide by the rules, no one would get anywhere, and the result
would be perpetual accident and collision. In thinking we simply
control and direct our impulses in the light of the consequences
we can foresee. To thus guide and control action makes us genuinely
free.
</p>

<p class="include">
If a man's actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, they
are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or
the circumstances of the moment. To cultivate unhindered, unreflective
external activity is to foster enslavement, for it leaves the person
at the mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>How We Think</i>, p. 67.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Instincts and habits are fixed responses; being placed in such and
such circumstances we <i>must</i> do such and such things. Only
when we can vary our actions in the light of our own thinking are
we masters of our environment rather than mechanically controlled
by it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The social importance of reflective behavior.</b> Reflection
<a name="page_60"><span class="page">Page 60</span></a> in the
life of the individual insures that he will not become the slave
of his own habits. He will regard habits as methods to be followed
when they produce good results, to be discarded or modified when they
do not. But if habit in the life of the individual needs control lest
it become dangerously controlling, it needs it more conspicuously
still in the life of the group. Unless the individuals that compose
a society are alert and conscious of the bearings of their actions,
they will be completely and mechanically controlled by the customs
to which they have been exposed in the early periods of their lives.
What an individual regards as right or wrong, what he will cherish
or champion in industry, government, and art, depends in large
measure on his early education and training and on the opinions and
beliefs of other people with whom he repeatedly comes in contact. A
society may be democratic in its political form and still autocratic
in fact if the majority of its citizens are merely machines which
can be set off to respond in certain determinate ways to customary
stimuli of names, leaders, and party slogans. A society becomes
genuinely democratic, precisely to the extent to which there is on
the part of its citizens participation in the important decisions
affecting all their lives. But the participation will only be a
formality if votes are decided and opinions formed on the basis
of habit alone.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflection removed from immediate application&mdash;Science.</b>
Thus far thinking has been discussed in its more practical aspects.
And thinking is in its origins a very practical matter. Literally,
most people think when they have to, and only when they have to. Given
a problem, a difficulty, a maladjustment between the individual and
his environment, thinking occurs. If every instinctive act brought
satisfaction, thinking would be much less necessary and much less
frequently practiced. This is illustrated in the performance of
any act that once required attention and discrimination, and has
later become habitual. We do not think how to walk, eat, and spell
familiar words, how to find our way about <a name="page_61"><span
class="page">Page 61</span></a> familiar streets or even in familiar
dark rooms. We <i>do</i> think about where we shall spend our evenings
or our summer, which courses we shall choose at college, which
profession we shall enter. Where we are uneasy, drawn by competing
impulses, we consider alternatives, measure consequences, and choose
our course of action in the light of the results we can forecast. But
while a large proportion of reflective behavior is thus practical
in its origins and its results, it also occurs not infrequently
where there is no immediate problem to be solved. Not all of men's
energies are concerned in purely practical concerns. And part of
man's superfluous vitality is expended in disinterested and curious
inquiry into problems whose solutions afford no immediate practical
benefits, but in the mere solving of which man finds satisfaction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the dawn of history, when some man a little more curious than
his fellows, a little less absorbed in the hunting, the food-getting,
and the fighting which were in those early days man's chief imperative
business, first began to observe the mysterious recurrences in the
world about him, the rising and setting of the sun, the return of
the seasons, the movements of the tides and the stars, there have
been individuals born with a marked and sometimes a passionate
desire to observe Nature and to generalize their observations.
They have noted that, given certain conditions, certain results
follow. They observe that animals with given similarities of form and
structure have certain identical ways of life, that some substances
are malleable and others not, that dew appears at certain times in
the day on certain objects and not on others. They have generalized
from these; and we now call such generalizations law. These
generalizations when gathered into a system constitute a science.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sciences started out with unconfirmed guesses based on not
very accurate information. As man's methods became more precise, he
controlled the conditions under which observations were made, and
the conditions under which generalizations <a name="page_62"><span
class="page">Page 62</span></a> were drawn from them. The control
of the conditions and methods of observation constitute what is
known as induction in science. To this phase of the reflective
process belong all the instruments for precise observation which
characterize the scientific laboratory. The control of the methods
by which generalizations or theories are built up from these facts
is also part of the logic of induction, and includes all the canons
and regulations for inductive inference.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But generalizations once made must be tested, and the elaboration
of these generalizations, the analysis of them into their precise
bearings, constitute that part of the process of reasoning known as
deduction. The final verification is again inductive, an experimental
corroboration of theories by the facts already at hand and by facts
additionally sought out and observed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(These processes will be discussed in detail in the chapter on "Science
and Scientific Method.")
</p>

<p class="indent">
However complicated the process of inquiry may become, the sciences
remain essentially man's mode of satisfying his disinterested curiosity
about the world in which he is living. Through the sciences man
makes himself, as has been so often said, at home in the world.
He substitutes for the "blooming, buzzing confusion" which is the
world as he first knows it, order, system, and law. Primitive man,
absurd as seems to us his belief in a world of magic, of malicious
demons and capricious gods, was trying to make sense out of the
meaningless medley in which he seemed to find himself. Through
science, modern man is likewise trying to make sense out of his
world. The more apparently disconnected and incongruous facts that
can be brought within the compass of simple and perfectly regular
law, the less threatening or capricious seems the world in which
we live. Where everything that happens is part of a system, we
do not need, like the savage trembling in a thunderstorm, to be
frightened at what will happen next. It is like moving in familiar
surroundings among familiar people. Not all that goes on may be
pleasant, <a name="page_63"><span class="page">Page 63</span></a>
but we can within limits predict what will happen, and are not
puzzled and pained by continuous shocks and surprises. We like
order in the places in which we live, in our homes, in our cities,
in the universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sciences satisfy us not only in that they bring order into
what at first seems the chaos of our surroundings, but in that they
are themselves beautiful in their spaciousness and their simplicity.
We cannot pause here to consider the physiological facts which make
us admire symmetry, but it is fundamental in our appreciation of
music, poetry, and the plastic arts. From the sciences, likewise,
we derive the satisfaction of symmetry on a magnificent scale.
There is beauty as of a great symphony in the sweep and movement of
the solar system. There is a quiet and infinite splendor about the
changeless and comparatively simple structure which physics, in the
broadest sense, reveals beneath the seeming multiplicity and variety
of things. It is a desire for beauty as well as a thoroughgoing
scientific passion which prompts men like Poincar&eacute; and Karl
Pearson to seek for one law, one formula which, like "one clear chord
to reach the ears of God," expresses the whole universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The practical aspect of science.</b> But while the origins of
science may lie in man's thirst for system, simplicity, and beauty
in the world, the tremendous advance of science has a more immediate
and practical cause. To understand the laws of Nature means to
have the power of prediction; it means to know that, given certain
circumstances, certain others follow always and inevitably; it means
to discover causes&mdash;and their effects. Man having attained
through patient inquiry this capacity to tell in advance, may take
advantage of it for his own good. The whole of modern industry
with its phenomenal control of natural powers and resources is
testimony to the use which man has found for the facts and laws
which he would never have found out save for the curiosity which was
his endowment and the inquiry which he made his habit. "Knowledge
is power," <a name="page_64"><span class="page">Page 64</span></a>
said Francis Bacon, and the three hundred years of science that have
made possible the whole modern world of electric transportation,
air travel between two continents, and instantaneous communication
between remote parts of the world, have proved the aphorism. Man
since his origin has tried to control his environment for his own
good. The cave and the flint were his first rude attempts. In science
with its accurate observation of facts not apparent to the unaided
eye, and its discovery and demonstration of laws not found by casual
and unsystematic common sense, man has an incomparably more refined
instrument, and an incomparably more effective one. Thus, paradoxically
enough, man's most disinterested and impartial activity is at the
same time his most practical asset.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The creation of beautiful objects and the expression of ideas
and feelings in beautiful form.</b> Most men spend most of their
lives necessarily in practical activity. Man's particular equipment
of instincts survived in "the struggle for existence" precisely
because they were practical, because they did help the human creature
to maintain his equilibrium in a half-friendly, half-hostile
environment. Man acquires also, as already has been pointed out,
habits that are useful to him, that bring him satisfactions not
attainable through the random instinctive responses which are his
at birth. Reflection, too, is, for the most part, severely practical
in its origins and its responsibilities. It guides action into
economical and useful channels.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Most of man's actions are thus ways of modifying his environment
for immediately practical purposes. Man has instincts and habits
which enable him to live. But in making those changes in the world
which enable him to live better, man, as it were by accident, makes
them beautifully. Pottery begins, for example, as a practical art,
but the skilled potter cannot help spending a little excess vitality
and habitual skill in adding a quite unnecessarily graceful curve,
a gratuitous decoration to the utilitarian vessel he is making.
<a name="page_65"><span class="page">Page 65</span></a> In the
words of Santayana, "What had to be done was, by imaginative races,
done imaginatively; what had to be spoken or made was spoken or
made fitly, lovingly, beautifully.... The ceaseless experimentation
and fermentation of ideas, in breeding what it had a propensity to
breed, came sometimes on figments that gave it delightful pause."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>Reason in Art</i>, p. 16.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
These accidental graces that man makes in the instinctive and habitual
control to which he subjects his environment become the most cherished
values of his experience. Men may first have come to speak poetry
accidentally, for language arose, like other human habits, as a
thing of use. But the charming and delightful expression of feelings
and ideas came to be cherished in themselves, so that what was first
an accident in man's life, may become a deliberate practice. When
this creation of beautiful objects, or the beautiful expression of
feelings or ideas is intentional, we call it art. In such intentional
creation and cherishing of the beautiful man's life becomes enriched
and emancipated. He learns not only to live, but to live beautifully.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In such activity men, as has been recognized by social reformers
from Plato to Bertrand Russell, are genuinely happy, and there alone
find freedom. For in the creation of beauty man is not performing
actions because he must, under the brutal compulsion of keeping
alive. He is acting simply because action is delightful both in
the process and in the result. Whether in business, politics, or
scholarship, men are happy to the extent to which they have the
sense of creation that is peculiarly the artist's.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The products of art, moreover, are not desirable because they bring
other goods, but because they themselves are intrinsically delightful.
Men love to live in a world in which their marble has been made
into statues, in which their houses are things of beauty rather
than merely places in which to live. Their lives are enriched by
living in a society where the thoughts and emotions which they
communicate to one <a name="page_66"><span class="page">Page
66</span></a> another and which they must somehow express can be
not infrequently expressed with nobility and music. Through science
Nature becomes man's tool; through art it can become a beautiful
instrument to work with, and a lovely thing in and for itself.

CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE BASIC HUMAN ACTIVITIES</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Food, shelter, and sex.</b> Thus far our analysis has been confined
to the general types of human behavior. We have found that all
human activity is conditioned by a native equipment consisting
of certain more or less specific tendencies to action, and that
these may be modified into acquired tendencies called "habits."
We have found that through the processes of reflection, through
imaginative trial and error, both of these may, within limits, be
controlled. We must now proceed to an inventory of those elements
of our native equipment which have an especial significance in
social life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the first place, we must note the three great primary drives of
human action, the unlearned and native demands for food, shelter,
and sex gratification.[1] Although the last-named does not display
itself in human beings until a considerable degree of maturity has
been attained there is indubitable evidence that it is an inborn
and not an acquired reaction. The practical utility of the first two
is apparent; they are the most essential features of the group of
so-called self-preservative instincts, among which may be grouped
the natural tendency to recover one's equilibrium and the instinct
of flight in the face of dangerous or threatening objects. The
utility of the sex instinct is racial rather than individual. The
instinctive satisfaction human beings find in sex gratification
is the natural guarantee of the continuance of the race.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The reader must be reminded that the simpler reflexes
involved in the use of the heart, lungs, intestines, and all the
internal organs, must be classed as part of man's native equipment.
They differ from those reactions commonly classed as instincts in
that they are simpler and stabler, that in their normal functioning
they never rise to consciousness, and that they are almost completely
beyond the individual's modification or control.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In a general survey of this nature it is impossible, as it is <a
name="page_68"><span class="page">Page 68</span></a> unnecessary,
to examine in detail the physiological elements of the demand for
food and shelter. It will suffice to point out that the first two
are the ultimate biological bases of a large proportion of our
economic activities. They are primary, not in the sense that they
are constantly conscious motives to action, but that their fulfillment
is prerequisite to the continuance of any of the other activities of
the organism. Agriculture and manufacture, the complicated systems
of credit and exchange which human beings have devised, are, for the
most part, contrivances for the fulfillment of these fundamental
demands. With the complexity of civilization new demands, of course,
arise, but these fundamental necessities are still the ultimate
mainsprings of economic production.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The demand for sex gratification, because of its enormous driving
force and the emotional disturbances connected with it, offers a
peculiarly acute instance of the difficulties brought about in
the control of man's native endowment in his own best interest.
While the production of offspring is its chief biological utility,
satisfaction of the sex instinct itself is stimulated in human
beings quite apart from considerations of the desirability or
undesirability of offspring. Since the sex instinct is at once
so deep-rooted and intense a driving force in human action, and
its consequences of such crucial importance to both those directly
involved and to the group as a whole, societies have, through law
and custom and tradition, built up elaborate codes for its control.
In civilized society the free operation of this instinct is checked
in a thousand ways. But, as in the case of other primitive motives
to action, the sex instinct, obvious as are the disasters of disease
and disorganization which follow as consequences of its uncontrolled
indulgence, cannot altogether be repressed.
</p>

<p class="include">
It is generally recognized that in men and animals alike the sex
impulse is apt to manifest itself in very vigorous and sustained
efforts toward its natural end; and that in ourselves it may determine
very strong desires, in the control of which all the organized
forces of the developed personality, all our moral sentiments and
<a name="page_69"><span class="page">Page 69</span></a> ideals,
and all the restraining influences of religion, law, custom and
convention too often are confronted with a task beyond their
strength.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>Social Psychology</i>, 11th ed., pp.
399-400.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is considerable agreement among students of the subject that
the emotional energies aroused in connection with the sex instinct
may be drained off into other channels, and serve to quicken and
sustain both artistic creation and appreciation and social and
religious enthusiasms of various kinds. And the sex instinct, as
we shall find in our discussion of Racial Continuity (see p. 243)
is the basis of the family.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Physical activity.</b> The difference between sticks and stones
and living beings consists primarily in the fact that the latter
are positively active; the former are passively acted upon. The
stone will stay put, unless moved by some external agent, but even
the am&oelig;ba will do something to its environment. It will stretch
out pseudopodia to reach solid objects to which to cling; it will
attempt to return to these objects when dislodged; it will actively
absorb food. Higher up in the animal scale, "Rats run about, smell,
dig, or gnaw, without real reference to the business in hand. In
the same way Jack (a dog) scrabbles and jumps, the kitten wanders
and picks, the otter slips about everywhere like ground lightning,
the elephant fumbles ceaselessly, the monkey pulls things about."[2]
"The most casual notice of the activities of a young child reveals
a ceaseless display of exploring and testing activity. Objects
are sucked, fingered and thumped; drawn and pushed, handled and
thrown."[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Hobhouse: <i>Mind in Evolution</i>, p. 195.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3 Dewey: <i>How We Think</i>, p. 31.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
When vitality is at its height in the waking period of a young
child, its environment is a succession of stimulations to activity.
Man's "innate tendency to fool" is notorious, a tendency particularly
noticeable in children. Objects are responded to, not as means to
ends, not with reference to their use, but simply for the sheer
satisfaction of manipulation. <a name="page_70"><span class="page">Page
70</span></a> Facial expressions, sounds, gestures, are made almost
on any provocation; they are the expressions of an abundant
"physiological uneasiness." The two-year-old is a mechanism that
simply must and will move about, make all kinds of superfluous
gestures and facial expressions, and random sounds, as it were, just
to get rid of its stored-up energy. Man's laziness and inertia are
not infrequently commented on by moralists, but it is not laziness
and inertia <i>per se</i>; certainly in normal individuals in the
temperate zone, to do <i>something</i> most of their waking time
is a natural tendency and one intrinsically pleasant to practice.
That the tendency to be active should vary in different individuals
and at different times is, of course, as important a fact as it
is a familiar one. Some of the causes of this variation will be
noted in the succeeding.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In adult life for casual and random activity is substituted activity
directed by some end or purpose which determines the responses
called into play. Professional and business, domestic and social
enterprises and obligations take up most of the adult's energy.
The contrast between the play of the child and the work of the
adult is that in the case of the former actions are done for their
own sake; and in the latter for some end. The child, we say, plays
"for the fun of the thing," the adult works for pay, for professional
success, for power, reputation, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But even in the adult the desire for play powerfully persists. Not
all the grown-up's energy is absorbed in his work, and even some
types of work, like that of the poet or painter, or the building-up
of a great business organization, may be intrinsically delightful and
self-sufficient activity. Under the conditions of modern industry,
however, especially of machine production, much&mdash;in many cases,
most&mdash;of the activity by which an individual earns his living,
utilizes only some of his native tendencies to act, while the working
day does not, under normal conditions, absorb all his energy. Whatever
vitality is not, therefore, absorbed in necessary work goes into
forms of purely gratuitous activity. Which form "play" <a
name="page_71"><span class="page">Page 71</span></a> shall take in
the adult depends on the degree to which certain impulses are in
him stronger than others, either by native endowment or cultivation,
and which impulses have not been sufficiently utilized in him during
the day's work. A man musically gifted will find his recreation
in some performance on a musical instrument, let us say; on the
other hand, if his work is music, those impulses, strong though
they be, that make him a musician, will have been sufficiently
exhausted in the day's work to make some other activity a more
satisfactory recreation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The relations between play and work can be better understood by a
consideration of the physiological importance of variety in activity.
A certain regular recurrence of response may be pleasant, as in
rowing or canoeing, or in listening to the rhythms of poetry or
music, but a prolonged repetition of precisely the same stimulus
or the same set of stimuli may make responses dissatisfying to
the degree of pain. Ideal activity, biologically, would be one
where every impulse was just sufficiently frequently called upon
to make response easy, fluent, and satisfactory.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The reason "work" has traditionally come to be regarded as unpleasant
and "play" as pleasant is not because the former is activity and
the second is torpor. Leisure does not necessarily mean laziness.
Many a vacation, a camping party, a walking expedition, is literally
more strenuous than the work an individual normally does. But work
means human energy expended for the sole purpose of accomplishing
some end. And an end involves the deliberate shutting-out of every
impulse which does not contribute to its fulfillment. A man weeding
a garden may tire of the weeding long before he is really physically
exhausted. One response is being repeatedly made, while at the
same time a dozen other impulses are being stimulated. When Tom
Sawyer, under the compulsion of his aunt, is whitewashing a fence,
it is shortly no fun for him. But he can make other boys pay him
apple-cores and jackknives for the fun of wielding the brush.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_72"><span class="page">Page 72</span></a> What we call
the feeling of boredom depends principally upon the too repeated
stimulation of one set of activities to the exclusion of all others,
the continuous presence of a kind of stimulation to which we have
been rendered unsusceptible, as, for example, bad popular music
to a cultivated musical taste, or intricate chamber music to an
uncultivated one. The feeling of boredom may become physiologically
acute, as in the case, so frequent in machine production, of literally
monotonous or one-operation jobs. Long hours of labor at acts calling
out only one very simple response may have very serious effects.
In the first place, in the work itself, since repetitions of one
or one simple set of responses may impair speed and accuracy. On
the part of the worker, it promotes varying degrees of stupefaction
or irritation. Excesses of drink, gambling, and dissipation among
factory populations are often traceable to this continual frustration
of normal instincts during working hours, followed by a violent
search for stimulation and relaxation after work is over. Under
conditions of machine production, the responses which the worker
must make are becoming increasingly simple and automatic. Hence
the problem of bringing variety into work and something of the
same vitality and spontaneity into industry that goes into play
and art is becoming serious and urgent.[1]

<p class="indent">
<b>Mental activity.</b> Just as physical activity is a characteristic
of all living beings, so, from almost earliest infancy of human
beings, is mental activity. This does not mean that individuals
from their babyhood are continually solving problems. Deliberation
and reflection are simply the mature and disciplined control of
what goes on during all of our waking hours&mdash;random play of
the fancy, imagination. We are not always controlling our thought,
but so long as we are awake something is, as we say, passing through
our heads. Everything that happens about us provokes some suggestion
or idea. "Day-dreaming, building of castles in the air, that loose
flux of casual and disconnected material that floats through our
<a name="page_73"><span class="page">Page 73</span></a> minds in
relaxed moments, are, in this random sense, <i>thinking</i>. More
of our waking life than we should care to admit, even to ourselves,
is likely to be whiled away in this inconsequential trifling with
idle fancy and unsubstantial hope."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>How We Think</i>, p. 2.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
This play of the imagination is most uncontrolled and spontaneous
in childhood, which is often characteristically defined as the
period of make-believe or fancy. It is this capacity which enables
the child to use chairs as locomotives, sticks as rifles, and
wheelbarrows as automobiles. As we grow older we tend to discipline
this vagrant dreaming, and to draw only those suggestions from
objects which tally with the workaday world we live in. We stop
playing with our imagination and put our minds to work. But in
adult life desire for the play of the mind, like the desire for
the play of the body, persists. The endeavor of education is not
to crush but to control it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Imagination, used here in the sense of random mental activity,
may be controlled in two ways, both significant for human welfare.
When it is controlled with reference to some emotional theme, as
in fiction, drama, and poetry, it has no reference necessarily to
actual objects or events; it is concerned only with producing the
effect of emotional congruity between incidents, objects, forms,
or sounds. A great novel does not pretend to be a literal transcript
of experience, nor a portrait of an actual person. When random
mental activity is thus controlled, it is "imagination," in the
popular sense, the sense in which poets, painters, and dramatists
are called imaginative artists.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Imagination controlled with reference to facts produces genuine
reflection and science. To put it in another way, no matter how
complicated thinking becomes, no matter how suggestions are examined
and regulated with reference to the facts at hand, new ideas, theories,
and hypotheses occur to the thinker precisely by this upshoot of
irresponsible fancies and suggestions. This free and fertile play
of the imagination <a name="page_74"><span class="page">Page
74</span></a> is what characterizes the original thinker more than
any other single fact. Suggestions arise, as it were, willy-nilly,
depending on an individual's inheritance, his past experience,
his social position, all at the moment uncontrollable features
of his situation. We can, through scientific method, examine and
regulate suggestions once they arise, but their appearance is in
a sense casual and unpredictable, like the fancies in a daydream.
The greatest scientific discoveries have been made in a sudden
"flash of imagination," as when to the mind of Darwin, after twenty
years' painstaking collection of facts, their explanation through
the single encompassing formula of evolution occurs, or when to
the mind of Newton the hypothesis of gravitation suddenly suggests
itself.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The encouragement of a lively play of the mind over experience,
the stimulation of imagination or what Bertrand Russell calls "the
joy of mental adventure" is thus one of the most important sources
of art and science. The arousing of imagination depends primarily
on the inherited curiosity of man which varies from the random
and restless exploring of the child to the careful and persistent
investigation of the trained scientist. The curiosity which prompts
the child to experiment with objects in a hit-or-miss fashion is
little more than the physiological overflow of action which has
been noted above.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Curiosity becomes more distinctively mental when it is social in
character, when the child explores and experiments not by its own
manipulations but by communication, by asking questions of other
people.
</p>

<p class="include">
When the child learns that he can appeal to others to eke out his
store of experiences, so that, if objects fail to respond interestingly
to his experiments, he may call upon persons to provide interesting
material, a new epoch sets in. "What is that?" "Why?" become the
unfailing signs of a child's presence. At first this questioning is
hardly more than a projection into social relations of the physical
overflow which earlier kept the child pushing and pulling, opening
and shutting. He asks in succession what holds up the house, what
holds up the soil that holds the house, what holds up the earth
that <a name="page_75"><span class="page">Page 75</span></a> holds
the soil; but his questions are not evidence of any genuine
consciousness of rational connections. His <i>why</i> is not a
demand for scientific explanation; the motive behind it is simply
eagerness for a larger acquaintance with the mysterious world in
which he is placed. The search is not for a law or principle, but
only for a bigger fact.... But in the feeling, however dim, that
the facts which directly meet the sense are not the whole story,
that there is more behind them and more to come from them, lies
the germ of <i>intellectual</i> curiosity.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 32.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Curiosity passes thus from casual rudimentary inquiry into genuinely
scientific investigation. At first it is merely physical manipulation,
then merely disconnected questionings; it becomes genuinely intellectual
when it passes from "inquisitiveness" to inquiry. To be inquisitive
means merely to want to know facts rather than to solve problems.
To be scientifically inquiring is to seek on one's own account
the significant relations between things. But these earlier and
more casual forms of curiosity are not to be despised. If developed
and controlled they lead to genuinely disinterested study of Nature
and of men, to the spirit and the methods of science. That free
play of imagination which was spoken of above as the chief source
of original thinking and discovery is stimulated by an active
hunting-out of new suggestions. Curiosity might also be defined
as aggressive imagination, which, frequent enough in children,
remains among adults to a pronounced degree only in geniuses of art
and science. We may not agree with Bertrand Russell that "everything
is done in education to kill it," but the dogmatism and fixity of
mind which so soon settle down on maturity, the inability to be
sensitive to new experiences, these are discouragingly familiar
phenomena clearly inimical to science and to progress.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An active imagination that finds new materials to play over is
the basis of both science and art. A skillful manipulation of its
materials in words or sounds, colors, or lines makes its result
art. Their controlled examination and systematization makes them
science.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_76"><span class="page">Page 76</span></a>
<b>Quiescence&mdash;Fatigue.</b> That all life, animal and human, is
characterized by activity of a more or less persistent and positive
kind has already been noted. But in human beings, as well as in animals,
activity displays a "fatigue curve." The repeated stimulation of
certain muscles produces fatigue toxins which impair the efficiency
of response and make further stimulation painful. Of the causes of
this lessened functional efficiency we may quote from Miss Goldmark's
painstaking study:
</p>

<p class="include">
During activity, as will be shown later, the products of chemical
change increase. A tired person is literally and actually a poisoned
person&mdash;poisoned by his own waste products. But so marvellously
is the body constructed that, like a running stream, it purifies
itself, and during repose these toxic impurities are normally burned
up by the oxygen brought by the blood, excreted by the kidneys,
destroyed in the liver, or eliminated from the body through the
lungs. So rest repaires fatigue.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Goldmark, J.: <i>Fatigue and Efficiency</i>, p. 13.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In physical activity, therefore, periods of lessened activity or
change of activity, or nearly complete inactivity as in sleep, are
not only desirable but necessary, if efficiency is to be maintained.
The demand for rest is an imperative physiological demand. The
amount of recuperation demanded by the organism varies in different
individuals, but that there are certain limits of human productivity
has been made increasingly clear by a careful study of the effects
of fatigue upon output in industrial occupations. Repeatedly, the
shortening of working hours, especially when they have previously
numbered more than eight, has been found to be correlated with an
increase in efficiency. Likewise, the provision of rest periods as
in telephone-operating and the needle trades, has in nearly every
case increased the amount and quality of the work performed. The
human machine in order to be most effective cannot be pressed too
hard. A striking illustration was offered in England at the beginning
of the war. Under pressure of war necessity, the munition factories
relaxed all <a name="page_77"><span class="page">Page 77</span></a>
restrictions on working hours and operated on a seven-day week.
The folly of this procedure was tersely summarized by the British
Commission investigating industrial fatigue, which reported: "It is
almost a commonplace that seven days' labor produces six days'
output."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the study of industrial conditions, the effects of prolonged
and repeated fatigue upon output have not been the only features
taken into consideration. Not only are there immediately observable
effects in the decreased output of the worker, but fatigue means,
among other things, general loss of control. This has the effect of
producing on the part of overworked factory hands dissipation and
overstimulation in free time, with a consequent permanent impairment
of efficiency.[1] Both for the laborer himself and for the efficiency
of the industrial system, it has been increasingly recognized that
limitation of working hours is imperatively demanded. Rest is as
fundamental a need as food, and its deprivation almost as serious
in its effects.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: For a striking array of testimony on this point see
Goldmark: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 220-35.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Nervous and mental fatigue.</b> The conditions of nervous and
mental fatigue have been less adequately studied than the types
of purely physiological fatigue just discussed. It is difficult
in experiments to discount the effects of muscular fatigue, and
to discover how far there is really impairment of nervous tissue
and functions. Experimental studies do show that "nervous fatigue
is an undoubted fact"[2] and that "we cannot deny fatigue to the
psychic centers"[3] which, like any other part of the organism are
subject to deterioration by fatigue toxins. Most students report,
however, a higher degree of resistance to fatigue in the nerve
fibers than in the muscles, and a like high resistance to fatigue
in the brain centers.[4]

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_78"><span class="page">Page 78</span></a> The conditions
of mental fatigue, however, can be by no means as simply described
as those of physical fatigue. Elaborate experiments by Professor
Thorndike and others tend to show that, in the strictest sense
of the term, there is no such thing as mental fatigue. That is,
any mental function may be performed for several hours with the
most negligible decrease in the efficiency of the results attained.
The subject of one experiment kept continuously for seven hours
performing mental multiplications of four-place numbers by four-place
numbers with scarcely any perceptible decrease in speed or accuracy
in results.[1] Professor Thorndike draws from this and similar
experiments the conclusion that it is practically impossible to
impair the efficiency of any mental function as such. What happens
when we say our mental efficiency is being impaired is rather that we
<i>will not</i> than that we <i>cannot</i> perform any given mental
function. The causes of loss of efficiency are rather competing
impulses[2] than fatigue in specific mental functions. We are tired
<i>of</i> the work, not <i>by</i> it. Continuous mental work of
any given kind, writing a book, solving problems in calculus,
translating French, etc., involves our being withheld from other
activities, games, music, or companionship, to which by force of
habit or instinct, we are diverted, and diverted more acutely the
more we remain at a fixed task. That it is not mental "fatigue"
so much as distraction that prevents us from persisting at work
is evidenced in the longer time we can stick to work that really
interests us than to tasks in which we have only a perfunctory or
compulsory interest. The college student who is "too dead tired"
to stay up studying trigonometry will, though in the same condition,
stay up studying football strategy, rehearsing for a varsity show,
or getting out the next morning's edition of his college paper.
"If each man did the mental work for which he was fit, and which
he enjoyed, men would work willingly much longer than they now
<a name="page_79"><span class="page">Page 79</span></a> do."[1*]
The effects of mental fatigue are, when analyzed, due chiefly to
the physically injurious effects that do, but do not necessarily,
accompany mental work.

<p class="include">
Proper air and light, proper posture and physical exercise, enough
food and sleep, and work whose purpose is rational, whose difficulty
is adapted to one's powers, and whose rewards are just, should
be tried before recourse to the abandonment of work itself. It
is indeed doubtful if sheer rest is the appropriate remedy for
a hundredth part of the injuries that result from mental work in
our present irrational conduct of it.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid</i>., p. 328.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The study of the conditions of mental work seems to reveal, in
brief, that the conditions of fatigue are essentially physical
in character. Given adequate physical conditions, in particular
guarding against eye-strain, over-excitement (which means distraction
from the work in hand), and loss of sleep, mental work is itself
peculiarly unaffected by fatigue conditions. The degree in which
mental work can be persisted in depends, therefore, other things
being equal, on the individual's own interests, the number and
intensity of rival interests which persist during a given piece
of mental work, and the habits of mind with which the individual
approaches his work.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The experimental demonstration that so-called mental fatigue is
largely physical in its conditions has thus a dual significance.
It indicates how arduous and persistent mental endeavor may be and
how wide are the possibilities of intellectual accomplishment. It
is an important fact for human life that the brain is possibly the
most tireless part of the human machine. What seems to be mental
fatigue can be materially reduced if the physical conditions under
which studying, writing, and all other kinds of mental work are
performed are carefully regulated. Another large part of what passes
for mental fatigue will be removed if the individual becomes trained
to a reflective appreciation of the end of his work. A habit of
alert and conscious attention, if it is really habitual, <a
name="page_80"><span class="page">Page 80</span></a> will enable
one to persist at work in the face of tempting distractions. Learning
to "tend to business" by an intelligent application to the aims
of the work to be done, will be a healthy antidote against that
yielding to every dissuading impulse which so often passes for
mental weariness.

CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE SOCIAL NATURE OF MAN</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Man as a social being.</b> Man has long been defined as the
"social animal," and it is certainly characteristic of human activity
that it takes place largely with reference to other people. Many of
man's native tendencies, such as those of sex, self-assertiveness,
and the like, require the presence and contact of other people for
their operation. Nineteenth-century philosophers attempted frequently
to explain how individuals who were natively self-seeking ever came
to act socially. The solution to this problem was usually found
in the fact that precisely those self-seeking and self-preservation
instincts which governed man's activity could not find satisfaction
except through co&ouml;peration with a group. All man's social
activity was conceived as purely instrumental to the gratification
of his own egoistic desires. Man got on with his fellows simply
because he could not get on without them. We shall see that, in the
light of the specific and natural tendencies toward social behavior
which are part of man's original equipment, this sharp psychological
isolation between the individual and the group is an altogether
unwarranted assumption. For it is just as native to man to act
socially as it is for him to be hungry, or curious, or afraid.
The element of truth in the nineteenth-century exaggeration of
man's individuality lies in the fact that social activity is partly
brought about in the satisfaction of the more egoistic impulses of
the individual. "The fear motive drives men together in times of
insecurity; the pugnacity motive bands them together for group
combat; the economic motive brings industrial co&ouml;peration
and organization; the self-assertive and submissive tendencies
bring emulation as well as obedience; the expansion of the self
to cover one's family, one's clique, one's class, one's country
contributes <a name="page_82"><span class="page">Page 82</span></a>
to loyalty; while the parental instinct, expanding its scope to cover
others besides children who are helpless, leads to self-sacrifice
and altruism."[1]

<p class="indent">
The fact is, however, that while social activity is promoted because
individuals find in co&ouml;peration the possibility of the satisfaction
of their egoistic desires, social activity is primarily brought
about through the specifically social tendencies which are part
of our native equipment. It is with these natural bases of social
activity that we shall in this chapter be particularly concerned.
We shall have to take note, in the first place, of a native tendency
to be with other people, to feel an unlearned sense of comfort in
their presence, and uneasiness if too much separated from them,
physically, or in action, feeling, or thought. Human beings tend,
furthermore, to reproduce sympathetically the emotions of others,
especially those of their own social and economic groups. Thirdly,
man's conduct is natively social in that he is by nature specifically
sensitive to praise and blame, that he will modify his conduct so
as to secure the one and avoid the other. Finally, besides the
specific tendencies to respond to the presence, the feelings, the
actions, and the thoughts of others, man displays a "capacity for
social behavior." And, as is the case with all native capacities,
man has, therefore, a native interest in group or social activity
for its own sake.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The predominantly social character of human behavior has thus a
twofold explanation. It is based, in the first place, on the group
of native tendencies of a social character to which we have already
referred. It is based, secondly, on the necessity for group activity
and co&ouml;peration which the individual experiences in the
satisfaction of his egoistic impulses and desires. Man, because
of his original tendencies, wants to live, act, think, and feel
with others; for the satisfaction of his nonsocial impulses he
must live with others. And in civilized society human action from
almost earliest childhood is in, and with reference to, a group. Human
behavior is thus seen to <a name="page_83"><span class="page">Page
83</span></a> be that of an essentially social nature acting in
an essentially social environment. And, as in the case of other
instinctive and habitual activities, human beings experience in
social activity an immediate satisfaction apart from any satisfactions
toward which it may be the instrument.

<p class="indent">
<b>Gregariousness.</b> The "herd instinct" is manifested by many
animals very low in the scale of animal development. McDougall
quotes in this connection Francis Galton's classical account of
this instinct in its crudest form: "Describing the South African ox
in Damaraland, he says he displays no affection for his fellows, and
hardly seems to notice their existence, so long as he is among them;
but, if he becomes separated from the herd, he displays an extreme
distress that will not let him rest until he succeeds in rejoining
it, when he hastens to bury himself in the midst of it, seeking
the closest possible contact with the bodies of his fellows."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>Social Psychology</i>, p. 84.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
This original tendency exhibits itself among human beings in a
variety of ways. The tendency of human beings to herd together,
for which there is evidence in the earliest history of the race,
may be observed on any crowded thoroughfare, or in any amusement
park, or city. That group life has expanded partly through practical
necessity, is, of course, true, but groups of humans tend to become,
as in our monster cities, larger than they need be, or can be for
economic efficiency.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fascination of city life has not infrequently been set down to
the multiplicity of opportunities offered in the way of companions,
amusements, and occupations after one's own taste. But the fascination
has clearly a more instinctive basis, the desire to be with other
people. Many a man, as has been pointed out, lives in a large city
as unsociable and secluded a life as if he were surrounded by miles
of mountain or prairie, who yet could not be happy elsewhere. Any
one who has failed to be amused by a really good comedy when the
theater was comparatively empty, or in the presence of thousands of
others hugely enjoyed a second-rate baseball <a name="page_84"><span
class="page">Page 84</span></a> game, or gone down to the crowded
shopping district to get what he could have purchased on a side-street
uptown, can appreciate how instinctive is this undiscriminating
desire for companionship.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The native intensity of this desire is what makes rural isolation,
on the other hand, so unsatisfactory. The bleakness of New England
country life as pictured in Edith Wharton's <i>Ethan Frome</i>,
or in some of Robert Frost's <i>North of Boston</i>, is due more
than anything else to this privation from companionship. Perhaps
nothing better could be said for the rural telephone, the interurban
trolley, and the cheap automobile than that they make possible the
fulfillment of this normal human longing to be near and with other
people in body and spirit. The horror which makes it practically
impossible in civilized countries to legalize punishment by solitary
confinement and the nervous collapse which such confinement brings
about are indications of how deep-seated is this desire.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The "herd instinct," like all the other of man's original tendencies,
is educable. It can be trained to respond to groups of various sizes
and kinds. In its simplest manifestation it tends to be aroused
by the family, but in the history of civilization the group tends
progressively to enlarge. The family, the town, the nation&mdash;the
gregarious instinct may be educated to respond to these ever-widening
groups. The intensity and controlling power of this instinct over
our actions seems to vary with the degree of intimacy and
intercommunication between the individual and the group. In primitive
society it is most intense among the family and clan, and the family
still remains in civilized society, certainly in rural districts, a
very closely knit primary group. But as intercommunication widens,
a sense of attachment to and solidarity with a larger group begins
to make itself felt. That intercommunication is largely important
in extending the group in response to which the herd instinct may
be aroused, is well illustrated by the utter lack of national group
feeling <a name="page_85"><span class="page">Page 85</span></a>
exhibited during the Great War by recruits drafted from the backwoods
districts where they had been tied by no railroads or newspapers
to the national civilization of which they were a part.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The devotion of generous-hearted souls to "lost causes," whether
political or religious, of the individual to his family or friends
in the face of personal privation, are classic illustrations of
the power of men's gregarious instinct even in the face of the
dictates of reason. In the perhaps extreme but nevertheless suggestive
statement of Mr. Trotter:
</p>

<p class="include">
He [man] is more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any
other influence. It can inhibit or stimulate his thought and conduct.
It is the source of his moral codes, of the sanctions of his ethics
and philosophy. It can endow him with energy, courage and endurance,
and can as easily take these away. It can make him acquiesce in his
own punishment, and embrace his executioner, submit to poverty, bow
to tyranny, and sink without complaint under starvation. Not merely
can it make him accept hardship and suffering unresistingly, but it
can make him accept as truth the explanation that his perfectly
preventable afflictions are sublimely just and gentle. It is this acme
of the power of herd suggestion that is perhaps the most absolutely
incontestable proof of the profoundly gregarious nature of man.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Trotter: <i>Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War</i>,
pp. 114-15.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To how large a group the individual can respond with spontaneous
and instinctive loyalty is questionable. The small child throws out
his arms and exclaims passionately, "I love the whole world." Auguste
Comte could be imbued with a fervor for "humanity" in the abstract.
The idea of a League of Nations arouses in some minds a passionate
devotion to a world order that to those themselves habituated to an
intense loyalty to the national group seems incredible. Certainly
it is true that we rapidly outgrow that state of mind common to
enthusiastic adolescence when we can develop a love for the universe
in the abstract. The instinct of gregariousness seems unquestionably
to be most intense where there is intimacy and vividness of group
association. The primary <a name="page_86"><span class="page">Page
86</span></a> groups, as Professor Ross calls them, are face-to-face
associations, the family, the play group, the neighborhood group.
If "world patriotism" is a possibility, it is because rapid
communication and the frequency of travel, and the education of
the industrial classes to "the international mind" tend to break
down barriers and to make distant countries and persons vivid and
directly imaginable. But there seems to be no substitute for direct
personal contact. Even devotion to a country tends to take the form
of phrases, places, persons, and symbols, to which we have been
familiarized.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Gregariousness important for social solidarity.</b> The gregarious
instinct, powerful as it is, is of the greatest significance for
social solidarity, and, if misdirected, for seriously limiting it.
It is, in the first place, the trait without which social solidarity
would be almost impossible. "In early times when population was
scanty, it must have played an important part in social evolution
by keeping men together, and thereby occasioning the need for social
laws and institutions."[1] The coherence of national, political,
or religious groups depends primarily on the extent to which the
gregarious instinct may be aroused. Allegiance to a group may, of
course, be secured through participation in common ideals. This
is illustrated in the case of the numerous literary and scientific
associations that cut across national boundaries and knit into
groups similarly interested persons all over the world. Groups
may, again, be formed through common economic interests, as in
the case of labor unions, or employers' associations. Groups may
be knit and strengthened through law and custom. And all these
factors play a smaller or larger part in any important grouping
of men in contemporary society. But unless there is, on the part
of the members of the group, a deep-seated emotional attachment to
the group itself, solidarity will be very precarious. The intensity
and solidarity, of feeling exhibited so markedly during war-time is
made possible by the intense excitability of this instinct when
the group is <a name="page_87"><span class="page">Page 87</span></a>
under conditions of stress or danger. Any scheme for enlisting a
great number of individuals in modern society in a scheme of social
reform or improvement, must and does, when it is successful, arouse
in him a heightened sense of loyalty to a group more than reasoned
approval of a cause. Effective recruiting posters more often told
the passer-by, "Your country needs you," than they attempted to
convince him in black-and-white logic of the justice of his country's
aims.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>Social Psychology</i>, p. 301.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Gregariousness may hinder the solidarity of large groups.</b>
While gregariousness is the foundation of group solidarity, it
also interferes with the solidarity of large groups, and not
infrequently brings about conflicts between them, and within groups
themselves. Within even so small a community as a college class,
cliques may form; and so in a country, attachment to the smaller
group may inhibit attachment to the larger. An individual may be
vaguely patriotic, but instinctively aroused more by his own economic
or local or racial group than by the country as a whole. A man may
at heart be more devoted to his town or home than to the United
States. (Not infrequently his town or home is what the United States
means to the citizen.) Even to-day the sectional feeling that exists
in many parts of the country cannot be completely explained as
occurring through separate economic interests. The division of
classes within a country is largely an economic matter, but even
in such a situation a loyalty develops to the class as a class
or group.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, the same instinct to herd with his fellows that makes a man
intensely loyal to his own group may operate to make him indifferent
to the difficulties or jealous and suspicious of the aims of others
Gregariousness is the basis not only of patriotism, but of chauvinism,
not only of civic pride, but of provincialism. The narrowness and
parochialism of group attachments is most pronounced where groups
and communities are rigidly set off one from another. In such
circumstances community of feeling and understanding is largely
reduced. <a name="page_88"><span class="page">Page 88</span></a> This
may be seen even under contemporary conditions in the comparatively
complete inability of different professional, social, and economic
groups within the same society to understand each other, and the
proverbial ignorance and carelessness of one half of the population
as to "how the other half lives." Narrowness of group feeling tends to
grow less pronounced under the mobile conditions of modern industry,
communication, and education. Trade relations knit the farthest
parts of the globe together; this morning's newspaper puts us in
touch with the whole of mankind. We have outgrown the days when
every stranger was an enemy. But though the barriers between nations
are tending to break down, within nations individuals tend, as
they grow older, to experience an insulated devotion to their own
set or social group, a callous oblivion to the needs and desires
of that great majority of mankind with whom they have a less keen
sense of "consciousness of kind."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Gregariousness in belief.</b> Man's gregarious character, as
already pointed out, is manifested not only in his desire to be
physically with his fellows, but to be at one with them in their
actions, feelings, and thoughts. Beliefs once established tend
to remain established if for no other reason than that they are
believed in by the majority. That an opinion gains prestige merely
because we know other people believe it, is frequently illustrated
by the facility with which rumor travels. At the end of the Great
War, it will be recalled, the false news of the armistice report
flew from mouth to mouth and was accepted with the most amazing
credulity simply because "everybody said so." The spread of
superstitions and old wives' tales and their long lingering in
the minds even of intelligent people is testimony that men tend
mentally as well as physically to herd together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The tendency to find comfort in the presence of one's fellows and
uneasiness if too much separated from them, is as pronounced in
the sphere of moral and intellectual relations as it is in the case
of merely physical proximity. We like to <a name="page_89"><span
class="page">Page 89</span></a> be one of a crowd in our opinions and
beliefs, as well as in our persons. There is hardly anything more
painful than the sense of being utterly alone in one's opinions.
Even the extreme dissenter from the accustomed ways of thinking and
feeling of the majority is associated with or pictures some little
group which agrees with him. And, if we cannot find contemporaries
to share our extreme opinions, we at least imagine some ideal group
now or in posterity to share it with us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Gregariousness in habits of action.</b> But if men tend to think
in groups they tend more emphatically still to act in groups, to be
acutely uncomfortable when acting in a fashion different from that
customary among the majority of their fellows. Habits of action are
more deep-seated physiologically than habits of thought (which is one
reason why our theories are so often in advance of our practice).
People will accede intellectually to new ideas which they would not
and could not practice, the mind being, as it were, more convertible
than the emotions. Even in minor matters, in dress, speech, and
manners, we like to do the accustomed thing. It is more painful
for most people to use the wrong fork at dinner, or to be dressed
in a business suit where everyone else is in evening clothes, than
to commit a fallacy, or to act upon prejudices rather than upon
logical conclusions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The individual's instinctive desire to be identical in action with
other members of his group, from the collars and clothes he wears
to the way he brings up his children, is greatly reinforced by the
punishment meted out to those who differ from the majority. This
may vary from ridicule, as in the case of the laughter that greets
the poet's proverbial long hair and flowing tie, the foreigner's
accent, or a straw hat in April, to the confinement and privation that
are the penalties for any marked infringement of the accepted modes
of life. Even when the punishments are slight, they are effective.
A man who has no moral or religious scruples with reference to
gambling on any day of the week will, to avoid the social ostracism
<a name="page_90"><span class="page">Page 90</span></a> of his
neighbors, refrain from playing cards on his front porch on Sunday.
For no other reason than to avoid being consciously different,
many a man will not wear cool white clothes on a hot day in his
office who will wear them on a cool evening at the seashore.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The effect of gregariousness on innovation.</b> A strong instinctive
tendency to community of action and thought is in large part responsible
for the comparative absence of innovation in either of these fields.
A premium is put upon the conventional, the customary, the common,
both in the instinctive satisfaction they give the individual, and
in the high value set upon them by society. In advanced societies,
however, the habit of inquiry and originality may itself come to be
endorsed by the majority, as it is among scientists and artists.
The herd instinct need not always act on the side of unreason.
Among the intellectual classes, it is already enlisted on the side
of free inquiry, which among scholars is the fundamental common
habit.
</p>

<p class="include">
If rationality were once to become really respectable, if we feared
the entertaining of an unverifiable opinion with the warmth with
which we fear using the wrong implement at the dinner table, if
the thought of holding a prejudice disgusted us as does a foul
disease, then the dangers of man's suggestibility would be turned
into advantages.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Trotter; <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 45.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Sympathy (a specialization of gregariousness).</b> Sympathy,
in the strict psychological sense of the term, means a "suffering
with, the experiencing of any feeling or emotion when and because
we observe in other persons or creatures the expression of that
feeling of emotion."[2] The behavior of animals exhibits the external
features of sympathetic action very clearly. "Two dogs begin to
growl or fight, and at once all the dogs within sound and sight
stiffen themselves, and show every symptom of anger. Or one beast
in a herd stands arrested, gazing in curiosity on some unfamiliar
object, and presently his fellows also, to whom the object may be
invisible, <a name="page_91"><span class="page">Page 91</span></a>
display curiosity and come up to join in the examination of the
object."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 93.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Human beings tend not only sympathetically to reproduce the instinctive
actions of others,[2] but they tend, despite themselves, to experience
directly and immediately, often involuntarily, the emotions experienced
and outwardly manifested by others. Almost everyone has had his mood
heightened to at least kindly joy by the presence in a crowded
street car of a young child whose inquiring prattle and light-hearted
laughter were subdued by the gray restraints and responsibilities of
maturity. One melancholy face can crush the joy of a boisterous and
cheerful party;[3] the eagerness and enthusiasm of an orator can,
irrespective of the merits of the cause he is defending, provoke
eagerness and enthusiasm for the same cause among an audience that
does not in the least understand what the orator is talking about.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: "In man infectious laughter or yawning, walking in
step, imitating the movements of a ropewalker, while watching him,
feeling a shock in one's legs when one sees a man falling, and a
hundred other occurrences of this kind are cases of physiological
sympathy." Ribot: <i>Psychology of the Emotions</i>, p. 232.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reproduction of the actions of others has by a certain school of
philosophers and psychologists, notably Tarde, Le Bon, and Baldwin,
been ascribed to imitation. But no experimental researches have
revealed any such specific instinct to imitate (see Thorndike,
p. 73 ff.), and "imitations" of acts can generally be traced to
sympathy, or suggestion&mdash;which is sympathy on an intellectual
plane.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: Such expressions as "kill joy," "wet blanket," "life
of the party" are instances of the popular appreciation of the
fact of social contagion.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
One brand of cigarettes was recently advertised by the face of a
young soldier, roguishly irresponsible, palpably and completely
given over to joy. One found one's self transported into something
of this same mood before one had a chance to speculate at all as to
whether there was any causal relation between the specific quality
of tobacco the youngster was smoking, and that contagious, undeniable
delight. What is called personal magnetism is perhaps more than
anything else the ability to provoke in others sympathetic experiences
of pleasant and exhilarating emotions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sensibility to the emotions of others, though possessed by <a
name="page_92"><span class="page">Page 92</span></a> almost all
individuals, varies in degree. The complete absence of it marks a
man out as "stolid," "cold," "callous," "brutal." Such a type of
personality may be efficient and successful in pursuits requiring
nothing besides a direct analysis of facts, uncolored by any irrelevant
access of feeling, as in the case of mathematics and mechanics. But
the geniuses even in strictly intellectual fields have frequently been
men of sensitiveness, delicacy, and responsiveness to the feelings
of others. That intellectual analysis, however, does frequently
blunt the poignancy of feeling is illustrated in the case of John
Stuart Mill, who writes in his <i>Autobiography</i>:
</p>

<p class="include">
Analytic habits may thus even strengthen the associations between
causes and effects, means and ends, but tend altogether to weaken
those which are, to speak familiarly, a <i>mere</i> matter of feeling.
They are, therefore, I thought, favorable to prudence and
clear-sightedness, but a perpetual worm at the root both of the
passions and of the virtues; and above all fearfully undermine
all desires and ... all except the purely physical and organic;
of the entire insufficiency of which to make life desirable, no
one had a stronger conviction than I had.... All those to whom I
looked up were of the opinion that the pleasure of sympathy with
human beings, and the feelings which made the good of others, and
especially of mankind on a large scale, the object of existence,
were the greatest and surest sources of happiness. Of the truth
of this I was convinced, but to know that a feeling would make
me happy if I had it, did not give me the feeling.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Autobiography</i> (Holt edition), p. 138.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
A generous degree of susceptibility to the emotions of others makes
a man what is variously called "mellow," "humane," "large-hearted,"
"generous-souled." The possession of such susceptibility is an
asset, first, in that it enriches life for its possessor. It gives
him a warm insight into the feelings, emotions, desires, habits
of mind and action of other people, and gives to his experiences
with them a vivid and personal significance not attainable by any
hollow intellectual analysis. It is an asset, moreover, in the
purely utilitarian business of dealing with men. The statesman or
executive <a name="page_93"><span class="page">Page 93</span></a>
who deals with men as so many animate machines, may achieve certain
mechanical and arbitrary successes. But he will be missing half the
data on which his decisions must be based if he does not have a
live and sensitive appreciation of how men feel when placed in given
situations. The placing of women in positions of labor management
where women chiefly are to be dealt with is an illustration of the
recognition of the importance of sympathy, fellow-feeling in the
management of human affairs. One of the reasons why many university
scholars make poor teachers is because they cannot place themselves
back at the point where a subject was as live and fresh and virgin
to them as it is to their students.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An extraordinary degree or a decided hypertrophy of emotional
susceptibility is as dangerous a trait as its possession in a reasonable
degree is a utility and an enrichment of life. It results in the
hysteria or sentimentalism which adds to the real evils and difficulties
of life fancied grievances and disasters. Such temperaments when
confronted with any good or beautiful action dissolve into ecstasy,
and when faced with a problem or a difficulty dissolve into tears.
Doctors will not treat their own children because the overplus
of sympathy is a hindrance to action. Sentimental ladies are not
the most efficient charity workers or prisoner reformers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While there is a general tendency to experience sympathetically
the feelings of others, this becomes specialized in most people,
and one tends to experience most immediately and intensely the
emotions of one's own kind, physically, socially, and intellectually.
Sympathy is a specialization of man's general gregariousness, and
becomes more specialized as one becomes habituated exclusively
to a small group. Within this small group, individuals not only
experience the emotions of others, but like to share and communicate
their own emotions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The nearer people are to us in mode of life, social status, and
intellectual interests, the closer is community of feeling and
"consciousness of kind." Two Americans meeting in a foreign <a
name="page_94"><span class="page">Page 94</span></a> country have
a quick and sympathetic understanding of each other. Two alumni
of the same college meeting in a distant city have a common basis
of interest and feeling.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This easy give-and-take of feeling and emotion makes the deep
attractiveness of intimate companionship. Our companion has but to
mention a name or a place, and we experience the same associations,
the pleasures, or antipathies which he does. A gesture, a curious
glance of the eye, a pause, we understand as quickly as if he had
spoken a sentence. But not only do we understand his feelings; he
(or she) understands ours. And for most people, all their interests
and enjoyments are heightened by the presence of an intimately
known companion.
</p>

<p class="include">
Many children manifest very clearly this tendency of active sympathy;
they demand that their every emotion shall be shared at once. "Oh,
come and look!" is their constant cry when out for a walk, and
every object that excites their curiosity or admiration is brought
at once, or pointed out, to their companion.... On the other hand,
another child, brought up, perhaps, under identical conditions, but
in whom this impulse is relatively weak, will explore a garden,
interested and excited for hours together, without once feeling
the need for sympathy, without once calling on others to share
his emotions.[1]

In adult life, few people care to go to theater or concert alone,

The fact that emotions exhibited in one individual are readily
aroused in another makes art possible and makes it interesting.
A poet by a phrase, a musician by a chord or melody, can suddenly
reproduce in us his own feeling of gayety or exaltation. A painter by
disposition of line and color can suggest the majesty of mountains,
or the sadness of a sunset as he himself has experienced it. In
novels and dramas we can <i>relive</i> the feelings that the writer
imagines to have been <a name="page_95"><span class="page">Page
95</span></a> experienced by others. It is testimony to the easy
excitability of sympathy as well as to an artist's skill that this
can sometimes be done in a few lines or paragraphs. Witness the
famous opening of Poe's <i>Fall of the House of Usher:</i>
</p>

<p class="include">
During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn
of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens,
I had been passing alone on horseback, through a singularly dreary
tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of
evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.
I know not how it was&mdash;but, with the first glimpse of the
building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say
insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that
half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind
usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate
or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me&mdash;upon the mere
house and the simple landscape features of the domain, upon the
bleak walls, upon the vacant eye-like windows, upon a few rank
sedges, and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees&mdash;with an
utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation
more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium;
the bitter lapse into everyday life, the hideous dropping off of the
veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart, an
unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination
could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it&mdash;I paused
to think&mdash;what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation
of the House of Usher?
</p>

<p class="indent">
To Aristotle tragedy seemed to afford a cleansing or "katharsis
of the soul" through the sympathetic experience of pity or fear.
To Schopenhauer music was the greatest of the arts because it made
us at one with the sorrows and the strivings of the world. All
the representative arts are vivid ways of making us feel with the
passions or emotions that stir mankind. And those men are poets,
painters, or musicians who, besides having a unique gift of expression,
whether in word, tone, or color, have themselves an unusually high
sensitivity to the moods of other men and to the imagined moods
of the natural scenes among which they move.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Poets generally are so susceptible to emotional shades
and nuances that they read them into situations where they are not
present, and then reproduce them sympathetically in their works.
The so-called "pathetic fallacy" is an excellent illustration of
this. Poets sympathize with the emotions of a landscape, emotions
which were in the first place, their own.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_96"><span class="page">Page 96</span></a> In experience,
the presence or absence of genuine sympathy with the emotions of
others determines to no small extent the character of our dealings
with them. Even courts of justice take motives into account and
juries have been known to ask for clemency for a murderer because
of their keen realization of the provocation which he had undergone.
Fellow-feeling with others may again warp our judgments or soften
them; in our judgment of the work of our friends, it is difficult
altogether to discount our personal interest and affection. On the
other hand, we may have the most sincere admiration and respect
for a man, and yet be seriously hampered in our dealings with him,
socially or professionally, by a total lack of sympathy with his
motives and desires.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Praise and blame.</b> An important part of man's social equipment
is his susceptibility to the praise and blame of his fellows. That
is, among the things which instinctively satisfy men are objective
marks of praise or approval on the part of other people; among the
things which annoy them, sometimes to the point of acute distress,
are marks of disapproval, scorn, or blame. This is illustrated
most simply and directly in the satisfaction felt at "intimate
approval as by smiles, pats," kindly words, or epithets applied
by other people to one's own actions or ideas, and the discomfort,
amounting sometimes to pain, that is felt at frowns, hoots, sneers,
and epithets of scorn or derision. One student of this subject notes
"as early as the fourth month a 'hurt' way of crying which seemed
to indicate a sense of personal slight. It was quite different from
the cry of pain or that of anger, but seemed about the same as
the cry of fright. The slightest tone of reproof would produce it.
On the other hand, if people took notice and laughed and encouraged,
she was hilarious."[1]

<p class="indent">
Man's sensitiveness to praise and blame is paralleled by his instinctive
tendency to express them.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_97"><span class="page">Page 97</span></a> Smiles,
respectful stares, and encouraging shouts occur, I think, as instinctive
responses to relief from hunger, rescue from fear, gorgeous display,
instinctive acts of strength and daring, victory, and other impressive
instinctive behavior that is harmless to the onlooker. Similarly,
frowns, hoots, and sneers seem bound as original responses to the
observation of empty-handedness, deformity, physical meanness,
pusillanimity, and defect. As in the case of all original tendencies,
such behavior is early complicated and in the end much distorted,
by training; but the resulting total cannot be explained by nurture
alone.[1]

<p class="indent">
Man's instinctive tendency to respond to praise and blame and to
exhibit them is, next to gregariousness&mdash;through which men
in the first place are able to live together&mdash;the individual
human trait most significant for social life. For while the desire
for praise, the avoidance of blame, and the expression of both are
instinctive, the occasions on which they are called forth depend
on the traditions and group habits to which the individual has
been exposed. He soon learns that in the society in which he is
living, certain acts will bring him the praise of others; certain
other acts will bring him their disapproval. The whole scope of
his activity may thus be profoundly modified by the penalties and
prizes in the way of praise and blame which society attaches to
different modes of action. And the more explicit and outward signs
there are of the approval or scorn of others, the more will individual
action be subject to social control.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As Plato said so long ago and said so well:
</p>

<p class="include">
Whenever they [the public] crowd to the popular assembly, the law
courts, the theaters, the camp, or any public gathering of large
bodies, and there sit in a dense and uproarious mass to censure
some of the things said or done, and applaud others, always in
excess; shouting and clapping, until, in addition to their own
noise, the rocks and the places wherein they are echo back redoubled
the uproar of their censure and applause. At such a moment, how
is a young man, think you, to retain his self-possession? Can any
private education that he has received hold out against such a
torrent of censure and applause, and avoid being swept away down
the stream, wherever it <a name="page_98"><span class="page">Page
98</span></a> may lead, until he is brought to adopt the language of
these men as to what is honorable and dishonorable, and to imitate
all their practices, and to become their very counterpart?[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Plato: <i>Republic</i> (Davies and Vaughn translation),
p. 208.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have already had occasion to point out that education is the
method by which society inculcates in its younger members habits
which are regarded as socially beneficial. In its broadest sense
the whole social environment is an individual's education. And
it is an education chiefly through experience with other people,
discovering what they will and will not tolerate, what they will
cherish and what they will condemn.
</p>

<p class="include">
The elaborate paraphernalia and rites of fashion in clothes exist
chiefly by virtue of their value as means of securing diffuse notice
and approval. The primitive sex display is now a minor cause: women
obviously dress for other women's eyes. Much the same is true of
subservience to fashions in furniture, food, manners, morals, and
religion. The institution of tipping, which began, perhaps, in
kindliness and was fostered by economic self-interest, is now well-nigh
impregnable because no man is brave enough to withstand the scorn of
a line of lackeys whom he heartily despises, or of a few onlookers
whom he will never see again.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Thorndike: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 32.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
One of the things we mean when we say a man is worldly-wise, shrewd,
knows human nature, is that he knows what will win people's admiration,
and knows, moreover, to distinguish between that which they publicly
condemn and secretly approve, and <i>vice versa</i>. In the passage
quoted above Plato was trying to show how the young Athenian acquired
not wisdom itself, but "worldly wisdom," the ability to get along
in affairs. This he learned not from the professional teachers,
but from the Athenian public, with whose approvals and disapprovals
he came in daily contact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Praise and blame modify habit.</b> In order to avoid censure
and gain the expressed approval of others, people learn, either,
as we say, through bitter experience, or deliberately, to modify
their actions. The well-brought-up child, even when its mother is not
about and its appetite unsatisfied, may be <a name="page_99"><span
class="page">Page 99</span></a> ashamed to say "Yes" to a second
offering of ice cream. The ten-year-old who likes to be coddled by
his mother in private would be acutely embarrassed to be "babied"
in the presence of other people. Among adults, likewise, actions
are checked, prompted, or modified by the praise and blame that
have become habitually associated with them. Men like to appear
virtuous, even if they do not like to practice virtue. It is not
only the professional politician who does generous acts for public
approval, nor is even the most disinterested and conscientious
work altogether free from being affected by the expressed attitudes
of approval or disapproval of other people. Even transportation
companies have found that they can increase the efficiency of their
employees by expressing in some form the approval of their employees'
courtesy and loyalty.[1] "A man, again, ... may fail to see any
'reason' why an elementary-school teacher or a second-division
clerk cannot do his work properly after he has been 'put in his
place' by some official who happens to combine personal callousness
with social superiority. But no statesman who did so could create
an effective educational or clerical service."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Many transportation companies maintain a merit system.
Sometimes they award special insignia, as the green flag to the
New York bus-drivers who save gasoline.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Wallas: <i>Great Society</i>, p. 197.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To say that we are moved to action by praise and blame is not to
indicate that actions thus motivated are done in a spirit of hypocrisy
or charlatanism. Even the most sincere acts are prompted or sustained,
especially where their performance involves serious personal privation
or sacrifice, by the imagined or actual approval of those whom
we love, admire, or respect. Whose praise and blame individuals
will care about depends on their education and temperamental
differences. That there will be some group, however small, is almost
sure to be the case. The poet who curls his lip at popular taste
cherishes the more keenly the applause of those whom he regards
as competent judges. The martyr will be unmoved by the curses, the
jeers, and the hoots of the contemporary <a name="page_100"><span
class="page">Page 100</span></a> multitude so long as he has the
trust of his small band of comrades or faith that the Lord approves
his ways. A man who is utterly alone in the approval of his actions
is regarded as crazy or is driven so by the perpetual disesteem
in which he is held. There have been cases in literature and life
of accused criminals who could bear up against the belief of the
whole world in their guilt so long as one friend or kinsman had
faith in them. That faith gone, they completely collapsed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Desire for praise may lead to the profession rather than the
practice of virtue.</b> While the desire for social approval is
strong in most men, so are other desires. It happens, moreover,
that the actions to which men's instincts prompt them are not always
such as would be approved by others.[1] In order, therefore, to
have their cake and eat it, to do what they please and yet seem
to please others, men often conceal the discrepancy between what
they profess and what they practice. One of the least agreeable
features of civilized society is the extent to which the codes
which men and groups profess differ from those by which they live.
Men who have ostensibly Christian codes of honor, and, indeed,
practice them in their private lives, will have an actual "ethics"
for business that they could not possibly sanction in their dealings
as trustees of a church. There are practices within trades and
professions, the familiar "trade" practices, and "ethics" of the
profession, which, for social as well as for professional reasons,
their practitioners would not want known. "Company" manners are a
trivial illustration of this, but there are more serious instances.
One has but to recall the sensation created a few years ago when a
minister of a fashionable congregation called upon his congregation
to practice Christianity, or, on a superb scale, Tolstoy's leaving
the estates and mode of life of a rich Russian noble, in order to
live the simple life he regarded as prescribed by the Christian
teaching.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: At least not publicly approved. There is, however,
admiration, often unconcealed, for the man who does even an unusual
act conspicuously well. One need only mention a Raffles or a Captain
Kidd.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: See Tolstoy's <i>Diary</i> and <i>Confessions</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_101"><span class="page">Page 101</span></a>
Psychologically, therefore, the cause of the discrepancy between
the codes which men preach and profess and those which they practice,
is thus seen to be a desire to secure illicit (that is, socially
unsanctioned) satisfactions without incurring the penalty of social
disapproval. Part of this discrepancy is not to be set down to the
evils men actually do so much as the irrationality and fanaticism
of the codes which they have been taught to profess. This is the
case, for example, where excessive Puritanism or fanaticism, not
possible for most men, is imposed upon them by an arbitrary and
fanatical teaching. They will then pretend to types of action socially
regarded as virtues in order to avoid the penalties incurred by not
practicing them. The desire for "respectability" is responsible
for no small amount of pretension, illustrated pathetically in cases
where individuals, to satisfy the standards of their associates,
live beyond their means physically, socially, or intellectually.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "Many Bostonians, <i>crede experto</i> (and inhabitants
of other cities, too, I fear), would be happier men and women to-day
if they could once for all abandon the notion of keeping up a Musical
Self and without shame let people hear them call a symphony a nuisance."
James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. I, p. 311.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, codes of action remain formally accepted long after they
have ceased to be taken seriously. In States that went "dry" where
there was no majority public sentiment in their favor, "bootlegging,"
the illicit making and selling of whiskey, was practiced freely,
because not many people regarded prohibition as a serious matter,
or its infringement as a serious crime. Legal codes remain not
infrequently a generation behind public opinion, and many ideas
are verbally professed that nobody takes quite seriously.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The social effectiveness of praise and blame.</b> How far the
social estimates of approval and disapproval affect the conduct of
the individual depends on the degree to which, through education,
public opinion, and law, he is made part of the group. In primitive
society, even the slightest details of conduct were regulated by
the group, through an elaborate system of punishments for slight
infringements. In civilized <a name="page_102"><span class="page">Page
102</span></a> society, the development of a sense of personal
selfhood and social recognition of its importance has to a degree
freed individual action from complete domination by the group. This
has in part been compensated by the education of the contemporary
citizen to national interests, and social sympathy, which render
him susceptible to the praise and blame of public opinion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The effectiveness of praise and blame in determining action depends
also on the explicitness with which they are expressed. In contemporary
life the control of public opinion is made precarious because there
is so rarely complete or palpable unanimity on any subject among
the variety of groups that constitute a modern society. In a large
city there are so many groups, so many sets of opinion, that an
individual may not feel any great pressure of praise and blame
except from the small circle of people with whom he is associated.
In small communities action is restrained by the fear of ostracism
or contempt of the whole group among whom one is living. But in
large cities, where one may not be known by one's next-door neighbor,
this restraint is much reduced. The temptations of a metropolis,
so often referred to in the lurid literature of the day, consist
not in temptations more numerous than or different from those in
smaller places, but in the marked absence of social control as
compared with small villages where every one knows everyone else's
business.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The influence of the social estimate on individual conduct depends
finally on individual differences in suggestibility. In normal
individuals susceptibility to the praise and blame of others is very
high, especially among the close circle of friends, professional and
business associates among whom one moves. This susceptibility is
heightened when the praise or blame comes from persons superior in
social status, though here the element of fear of the consequences
of displeasing is perhaps more important than the responsiveness
to the praise and blame itself. To the praise and blame of close
associates most men are also highly suggestible, not less so when
there <a name="page_103"><span class="page">Page 103</span></a> is
equality in social status. "Birds of a feather flock together,"
but humans tend to <i>become</i> similar <i>because</i> they flock
together. There are few men who can withstand the pressure of doing
what their group approves, and refraining from doing what it
disapproves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In some men susceptibility to the attitudes of others is extremely
low, and of such are both criminals and martyrs made. In the prisons
of this country there are a large number of men absolutely indifferent
to the usual social standards, completely undeterred by the codes
of conduct by which other people cannot help but be governed. Such
absolute callousness to the feelings which govern the majority
of mankind as we read of every now and then in the trial of some
desperate criminal, is not infrequently associated with abnormally
low intelligence, the sodden stolidity of the traditional criminal
type. Where it appears, as it sometimes does, in criminals of high
intelligence, it is regarded by psychiatrists as a specific abnormality,
comparable to color-blindness or a physical deformity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, on the other hand, individuals whose apparent low
suggestibility is of the highest social value. There are striking
instances, throughout the long struggle toward human liberty, of
persons who could withstand the public opinion of their own day in
the light of some ideal which they cherished, of men who needed no
other approval than their consciences, their better selves, or their
god. Socrates drinking the fatal hemlock, Christ upon the cross,
the Christian saints, Joan of Arc, the extreme dissenters of every
generation, are instances of men and women seemingly unmoved by the
praise and blame of their contemporaries. Sustained by their deep
inner conviction of the justice and significance of their mission,
they have been content to suffer scorn, ridicule, and martyrdom at
the hands of their own generation in a persistent devotion to what
in their eyes constituted the highest good of mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Social estimates and standards of conduct.</b> Individuals <a
name="page_104"><span class="page">Page 104</span></a> are early
habituated to the customs of the society in which they live, and
come to approve, as might be expected from the power of men's habits
and from their instinctive gregariousness, those things which they
or their companions have always done. That "people don't do such
things," or that "everybody does them," is a frequently assigned
reason for the approval or condemnation of an act. Social approvals
thus become affixed to acts which are regularly done by the majority,
and divergences are subjected to varying degrees of censure. In
civilized societies variations from customs that are not legally
enforced are punished mainly by social ostracism. There is no law
against walking down a crowded city street in Elizabethan costume,
yet few would indulge their taste for beautiful but archaic dress
in the face of all the ridicule they would incur. The whole system
of etiquette, of the standard of living of respectable society,
is maintained in large part because of the approvals and outward
marks of admiration that go to some types of life and the contempt
in which others are held. Much of the economic activity of the
leisure class, as Professor Veblen has so well pointed out, is
devoted to wasting time and spending money conspicuously as outward
indications that the individual is living up to established and
approved standards.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Veblen: <i>Theory of the Leisure Class.</i>]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The more significant folkways, standards of importance and unimportance,
of the admirable and the despicable, the noble and the base, are
determined by approvals and disapprovals that have become socially
habitual. When we speak of a country being imperialistic or
materialistic, we mean that most individuals in it, or at least
those who are articulate or influential, perform or approve of
actions leading to national or individual aggrandizement. The amount
of money, time, and energy that is spent on amusement, public works,
education, the army and navy is a fairly accurate gauge of the
relative group approvals they have respectively secured. In the
same way the professions and occupations in which men engage <a
name="page_105"><span class="page">Page 105</span></a> are determined
by the social prestige attaching to them no less than by economic
considerations. The pay of stenographers is no less than that of
primary-school teachers; it is often much more; yet many a girl
remains a teacher for the gentility which is traditionally associated
with the profession. In the same way many girls, in spite of the fact
that they are economically and physically better off in domestic
service than in factory work, still prefer the latter because of the
social inferiority which is associated with the servant's position.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Approvals and disapprovals become fixed to acts, in the first place,
because of some supposed danger or utility they possess. But whether
the acts are really socially useful or not, approvals and censures
once fixed tend to remain habitual, even though the conditions
which first called them forth are utterly changed. We are to-day
still more shocked by errors in etiquette than in logic; we are
still horrified by the infringement of a law which, if we stopped
to consider it, is not now, if it ever was, of any genuine service
to mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In advanced societies approvals are not always reserved for the
habitual. Certainly in science original research and discovery are
generally welcomed. In art originality is cherished, at least by
the discriminating.[1] Variation in action is for reasons discussed in
other connections less generally welcomed. But in advanced societies,
criticism and reflection upon social institutions and habits may
themselves come to be sanctioned and encouraged. Already we are
beginning to endow the scientific study of government and industrial
relations, and regarding with favor genuine inquiry into the
possibilities of progress.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Even in art most people's approvals and disapprovals
are fixed by what is called "good taste," which consists not
infrequently in approving what other people approve. &AElig;sthetic
approval thus becomes approval of the customarily recognized. It
took a Ruskin to make the neglected genius of Turner fashionable.
Keats and Byron were bitterly attacked by the orthodox critics
of their generation.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Importance of relating praise and blame to socially important <a
name="page_106"><span class="page">Page 106</span></a> conduct.</b>
What people approve and disapprove, if their approval becomes
sufficiently emphatic, is fixed by law. Law is the official and
permanent preservation and enforcement of public approval and
condemnation. When certain acts are regarded as of crucial importance,
the group does not depend on the precarious effectiveness of public
opinion, but deliberately attaches punishments to the performance
of undesired acts, and, more infrequently, rewards to the practices
of others. Most of our laws are enforcement of social condemnations,
for the performance or the non-performance of specific acts, rather
than direct encouragements of action. But which laws will be passed
depends in the first place on social approval or public opinion.
And if, as happens in our complicated political machinery, laws are
passed which have not the sanction of widespread public approval,
they remain "dead letters."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Outside the field of legal control, individual action is controlled
primarily by public opinion. There are many practices, strictly
speaking "within the law," that an increasingly enlightened public
opinion will not sanction; there are many practices encouraged
by an enlightened public which no law compels. There is no law
forcing business establishments to close every Saturday during
the summer, yet many now do. There are many courtesies practiced
by them which are not ordained by law. That adverse public opinion
may have economic consequences if disregarded is evidenced by the
powerful instrument the Consumers' League found in advertising
against firms that maintained particularly unsanitary and morally
degrading working conditions for their employees, or the dread
that hotels and department stores have for adverse publicity. The
phenomenal development of modern advertising is an instance of the
direct economic values that have been found in winning public approval.
There is more than metaphor in the statement made during the war that
Lord Northcliffe, as owner of a chain of English newspapers with
an immense circulation, was a "cabinet minister without portfolio."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_107"><span class="page">Page 107</span></a> The growth
of humanitarian sentiment has frequently enforced the improvement of
labor and social conditions before improvements were made compulsory
by law. And in that field of personal relations, which constitute so
large a part of our daily life, our conduct is controlled almost
entirely by the force of the public opinion with which we come
in contact. There is much more courtesy and kindliness and
co&ouml;peration manifested in the ordinary contacts of life of a
modern city than is required, or ever could be secured by statute.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Education as the agency of social control.</b> There is enormous
power in the habits of approval or disapproval to which we have,
in our early days, been subjected by our parents, teachers, and
companions. It is through education, in the broadest sense, that
the young come to learn, and hence to practice, those actions which
are socially approved, and by the same token to avoid those acts
which are socially condemned. Through formal education the adult
members of a society impress upon the plastic minds of the immature
those habits of thought and action which are currently recognized
as desirable. Education thus becomes the crucial instrument by
which social standards are established and transmitted.
</p>

<p class="include">
Society exists through a process of transmission quite as much as
biological life. The transmission occurs by means of communication
of habits of doing, thinking, and feeling, from the older to the
younger. Without this communication of ideals, hopes, expectations,
standards, opinions, from those members of society who are passing
out of the group life to those who are coming into it, society
could not survive.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey; <i>Democracy and Education</i>, pp. 3-4.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Society survives through education. Just as truly might it be said
that the kind of society, art, culture, industry, religion, science
that does survive depends on the kind of likes and dislikes that
are through education made habitual in the young.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Education, however, may not only transmit existing standards, but
can be used to inculcate newer and better expectations <a
name="page_108"><span class="page">Page 108</span></a> and ideals.
In the adult, habits are already set physiologically, and kept
rigid by the demands of economic life. In the young there is a
"fairer and freer" field. Through education the immature may be
taught to approve ways of action more desirable than those which
have become habitual with their adult contemporaries. The children
of to-day may acquire habits of action, feeling, and thought that
will be their enlightened practice as the adults of to-morrow.
All great social reformers, from Plato to our own contemporaries
like Bertrand Russell, have seen in education, therefore, the chief
instrument, as it is the chief problem, of social betterment. We
may train the maturing generation to approve modes of behavior
which the best minds of our time may have found reason to think
desirable, but which could not be substituted immediately for the
fixed habits of the already adult generation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Social activity, and the social motive.</b> In our analysis
of the social nature of man we have, thus far, been dealing with
his specific social tendencies. But apart from these, or rather
as an outgrowth of these, men exhibit what Professor Woodworth
has well described as a gift for "learning" social behavior.
</p>

<p class="include">
Possessing, as he eminently does, the capacity for group activity,
man is interested in such activity. He needs no ulterior motive
to attract him to it. It is play for him.... The social interest
is part and parcel of the general <i>objective</i> interest of
man.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Woodworth: <i>Dynamic Psychology</i>, pp. 202, 203.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In other words, the activity of man as an individual is not simply
deflected a little by man's native gregariousness, sympathy, and
susceptibility to praise and blame. Rather, group activity becomes
to the gregarious human, born into an environment where he must
act with and among other human beings, an interesting and exciting
activity in and for itself. Men enjoy working in a group or a society
for joint and common objects just as they enjoy food or musical
composition or golf.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_109"><span class="page">Page 109</span></a> The social
motive is of the same order as the musical or mathematical motive.
Just as one who has the musical gift takes to music naturally and finds
it interesting for its own sake, so the socially gifted individual
understands other people, sees the possibilities of collective
activity, and the ways of co&ouml;rdinating it, and enters into
such doings with gusto.... The social gift is a capacity for
<i>learning</i> social behavior. Individuals differ in degree in
the social gift, as in other capacities; some are capable of becoming
creative artists or inventors along social lines.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Woodworth: <i>Dynamic Psychology</i>, p. 203.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The social behavior of man is thus seen to be no curious anomaly
and contradiction in the life of an otherwise thoroughly egoistic
individual. Man is instinctively social; he finds social activity
useful in the satisfaction of his own desires, and he comes from
his native tendencies and acquired habits of social behavior to
enjoy and take part in social activities for their own sake. The
individual does not have to be coerced into social activity; he finds
in such behavior the same pleasure that attends the fulfillment of
any of his native or acquired reactions. Society has been variously
pictured as a force holding the individual in check, as an organism
of which he is a part, as a machine of which he is a cog. Society
consists rather as the collective name for the co&ouml;perative
and associated activities of human beings who find such activity,
by nature and by habit, interesting for its own sake.

CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">CRUCIAL TRAITS IN SOCIAL LIFE</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The interpenetration of human traits.</b> This chapter is devoted to
a consideration of a number of individual human traits&mdash;curiosity,
pugnacity, leadership, fear, love, hate, etc., and some of their
more important social consequences. These are seldom present in
isolation. A man is not, under normal circumstances, simply and
solely pugnacious, curious, tired, submissive, or acquisitive.
One's desire to own a particular house at a particular location
may be complicated by the presence of several of these traits at
once. The house may be wanted simply as a possession, a crude
satisfaction of our native acquisitiveness. It may be sought further
as a mode of self-display, an indication of how one has risen in
the world. Its attractiveness may be heightened by the fact that
it is situated next door to the house of a rather particularly
companionable old friend. It may be peculiarly indispensable to
one's satisfaction because it is also being sought by a detested
rival. Moreover, as we shall see in the discussion of the Self,
these traits are interwoven with each other and attain varying
degrees of power as motive forces in an individual's character.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while these distinctive human traits are seldom apparent in
isolation, it is worth while to consider them separately, not only
because the elements of human behavior will thus stand out more
clearly, but because in certain individuals one or another of
these-traits may be natively of especial strength. And further,
in differing social situations, the possession or the cultivation
of one or another of these native endowments may be of particular
social value or danger. And in any given situation, one or another
of them may be predominant, as when a man is intensely angry, or
curious, or tired. Thus an <a name="page_111"><span class="page">Page
111</span></a> individual may have a marked capacity for leadership,
or an extraordinarily tireless curiosity, or an abnormally developed
pugnacity or acquisitiveness. The capacity for leadership, as will
later be discussed in some detail, will be of particular social
value in large enterprises; patient and persistent inquiry may
produce science; pugnacity when freely expressed may provoke quarrels,
bickerings, and war. In the following discussion, the continual
interpenetration and qualification of these traits by one another
in a complex situation must be recognized. Else it may appear in
the discussion of any single trait, as if by means of it all human
action were being explained. Rather the aim is to trace them as one
might the elements in the pattern of a tapestry, or the recurrent
themes in the development of a symphony. But as the symphony is
more than a single melody, the tapestry more than one element of
line or color, so is human life more than any single trait.[1]

[Footnote 1: Philosophers and others have time and again made the
mistake of simplifying human life to a single motive or driving power.
Hobbes rested his case on fear; Bain and Sutherland on sympathy; Tarde
on imitation; Adam Smith and Bentham on enlightened self-interest. In
our own day the Freudians interpret everything as being sexual in
its motive. And most recently has come an interpretation of life,
as in Bertrand Russell and Helen Marot, in terms of the "creative
impulse."]

<b>The fighting instinct.</b> Almost all men exhibit in varying
degrees the "fighting instinct"; that is, the tendency, when interfered
with in the performance of any action prompted by any other instinct,
to threaten, attack, and not infrequently, if successful in attack,
to punish and bully the individual interfering.
</p>

<p class="include">
The most mean-spirited cur will angrily resent any attempt to take
away its bone, if it is hungry; a healthy infant very early displays
anger if its meal is interrupted, and all through life most men
find it difficult to suppress irritation on similar occasions.
In the animal world the most furious excitement of this instinct
is provoked in the male of many species by any interference with
the satisfaction of the sexual impulse.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 60.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_112"><span class="page">Page 112</span></a> This
original tendency to fight is very persistent in human beings, but
is susceptible of direction, and is not, in civilized life, frequently
revealed in its crude and direct form, save among children and among
adults under intense provocation and excitement. Occasionally,
however, pugnacity is displayed in its simple animal form. "Man shares
with many of the animals the tendency to frighten his opponent
by loud roars or bellowings.... Many a little boy has, without
example or suggestion, suddenly taken to running with open mouth
to bite the person who has angered him, much to the distress of his
parents."[1] As the individual grows older, he learns to control
the outward and immediate expression of this powerful and persistent
human trait. He learns in his dealings with other people not to give
way, when frustrated in some action or ambition, to mere animal
rage. The customs and manners to which a child is early subjected
in civilized intercourse are effective hindrances to uncontrolled
display of anger and pugnacity; superior intelligence and education
find more refined ways than kicking, pummeling, and scratching of
overcoming the interferences of others. But even in gentle and
cultured persons, an insult, a disappointment, a blow will provoke
the tell-tale signs of pugnacity and anger, the flushing of the
cheeks, the flash of the eye, the incipient clenching of the fists,
the compressing of the teeth and lips, and the trembling of the
voice. We substitute sarcasm for punching, and find subtly civilized,
and, in the long run, more terrible, ways than bruises of punishing
those who oppose us in our play, our passions, our professions. But
our ancestors were beasts of prey, and there is still "fighting
in our blood."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 61.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fighting instinct is aroused by both personal and impersonal
situations, and is occasioned even by very slight interferences,
and even when the author of the interference is neither human nor
animate. Quite intelligent men have been known to kick angrily at
a door as if from pure malice it refused <a name="page_113"><span
class="page">Page 113</span></a> to open. Irate commuters have
glared vindictively at trains they have just missed. The glint of
anger is roused in our eye by an insolent stare, an ironic comment,
or an impertinent retort. The "boiling point" varies in different
individuals and races, and pugnacity is generally more readily roused
in men than in women. There are some persons, like the proverbial
Irishman, who, seeing the slightest opportunity for a fight, "want
to know whether it is private, or whether anybody can get in." In
most men pugnacity is more intense when it is provoked by persons;
except for a moment, one does not try to fight a chair struck in
the dark.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Under the conditions of civilized life the primitive expression of
pugnacity in physical combat has been outlawed and made unnecessary
by law and custom. Individuals are prevented by the fear of punishment,
besides their early training and habits, from settling disputes by
physical force. But as the instinct itself remains strong, it must
find some other outlet. This it secures in more refined forms of
rivalry, in business and sport, or, all through human history, in
fighting between groups, from the squabbling and perpetual raids
and killings, and the extermination of whole villages and tribes
in Central Borneo, to the wars between nations throughout European
history.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Pugnacity a menace when uncontrolled.</b> The strength and
persistency of this human tendency, when uncontrolled or when fostered
between groups, make it a very serious menace. Like all the other
instincts, and more than most, it is frustrated and continually
checked in the normal peace-time pursuits of contemporary civilization.
Participation, imaginative at least, in a great collective combat
undoubtedly holds some fascination for the citizens of modern industrial
society, despite the large-scale horror which war is in itself, and the
desolation it leaves in its wake. During peace the fighting instinct
for most men receives satisfaction on a small scale, sometimes in
nothing more important than small bickerings and peevishness, or
in seeing at first hand or on the ticker a <a name="page_114"><span
class="page">Page 114</span></a> championship prize-fight. The
pessimism which many writers have expressed at the possibility
of perpetual peace rests in part on their perception of the easy
excitability and deep persistence of this impulse, especially among
the vigorous and young.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not only may the fighting instinct be aroused by the possibility of
international wars, but it may be used by fomenters and agitators
to add a sense of intense pugnacity and violent anger to the genuine
friction that does exist between conflicting interests in the same
society. The theory of a "class war" possibly finds its appeal for
many minds as much in its picturesque stimulation of their instincts
of pugnacity as in the logic of its economics.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Pugnacity as a beneficent social force.</b> While the power of
pugnacity and its easy stimulation makes this instinct a peculiarly
inflammable and dangerous motive force in civilized society, it is,
on the other hand, an indispensable source of social progress.
Many psychologists and sociologists, such as McDougall, Bagehot, and
Lang, attribute the superiority in culture and social organization
of the European races over, say, the Chinese and East Indians, to
the fighting instinct. In the long series of wars that for centuries
constituted much of the history of Europe, those nations which
survived, as in earlier times those tribes which survived combat,
were those which displayed marked qualities of superiority in
allegiance, fidelity, and social co&ouml;peration. The intensity
and effectiveness of social co&ouml;peration in our own country
was never so well illustrated as during the Great War. In combat
between groups those groups survive which do stand out in these
respects.
</p>

<p class="indent">
William James in a famous essay[1] recognizes clearly the enormous
value of the fighting instinct in stimulating action to an intense
effectiveness exhibited under no other circumstances, and proposes
a "moral equivalent for war"&mdash;an army devoted to constructive
enterprises, reclaiming the <a name="page_115"><span class="page">Page
115</span></a> waste places of the land, warring against poverty and
disease and the like. Certainly every great reform movement has been
intensely stimulated and has gathered about it the energies of men
when it has become a "crusade for righteousness." Part of Theodore
Roosevelt's power was in his picturesque phrasing of political issues
as if they were great moral struggles. No one could forget, or
fail to have his heart beat a trifle faster at Roosevelt's trumpet
call in the 1912 campaign: "We stand at Armageddon and we battle
for the Lord." His "Big Stick" became a potent political symbol.
Astute political leaders have not failed to capitalize the fighting
instinct, and any social project will enlist the wider enthusiasm
and the more energetic support if it is hailed as a battle or fight
against somebody or something.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "A Moral Equivalent of War," in <i>Memories and
Studies</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In personal life also the instinct of pugnacity and the feeling
of anger that goes with it seem to set loose immense floods of
reserve energy. McDougall exaggerates but a trifle when he says
it supplies the zest and determines the forms of all our games
and recreations, and nine tenths of the world's work is done by
it. "Our educational system is founded upon it; it is the social
force underlying an immense amount of strenuous exertion; to it we
owe in a great measure even our science, our literature, and our
art; for it is a strong, perhaps an essential, element of ambition,
that last infirmity of noble minds."[1] In the overcoming of obstacles,
whether in the work itself, or in the difficulties that a surgeon
or a scholar meets with, or in frustrations deliberately put in
our way by other people, pugnacity is an invaluable stimulant and
sustainer of action. Every great personality of strong convictions
and dominant energy has possessed it to some extent; in characters
of great moral energy it sometimes takes the form of a volcanic and
virtuous wrath, as in the case of the Prophets of the Old Testament,
or of later religious and social reformers who brought an earnest
and bitter anger against the wrongs they saw and literally fought
to overcome.

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_116"><span class="page">Page 116</span></a> <b>The
"submissive instinct."</b> Of great importance in the social relations
of men is their original tendency to find satisfaction in following,
partly submitting to, or completely surrendering to a person or
cause more dominating than the individual. Thorndike describes
this instinct in its simplest form:
</p>

<p class="include">
There is an original tendency to respond to the situation, "the
presence of a human being larger than one's self, of angry or mastering
aspect," and to blows and restraint by submissive behavior. When
weak from wounds, sickness, or fatigue, the tendency is stronger.
The man who is bigger, who can outyell and outstare us, who can
hit us without our hitting him, and who can keep us from moving,
does originally extort a crestfallen, abashed physique and mind.
Women in general are thus by original nature submissive to men
in general. Every human being thus tends by original nature to
arrive at a status of mastery or submission toward every other human
being, and even under the more intelligent customs of civilized
life somewhat of the tendency persists in many men.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>Educational Psychology</i>, briefer course,
p. 34.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The impulse to follow and submit to something not ourselves and
more dominating than ourselves is very strong in most men, and
is called out by stimuli much less violent than those physical
manifestations of power mentioned in the above quotation. Men
instinctively long to be led, especially if, as happens in the
case of most individuals, there is in them a marked absence of
definite interest, conviction, or skill. This instinct is aroused
by any sign of exceptional power, or, more generally still, by
any exceptional conspicuousness, whether socially useful or not.
Men follow leaders partly because men live in groups with common
interests and in any large-scale organization leadership is necessary.
But the power of demagogues, the faithfulness with which men will
follow a bad leader as well as a good, are evidence that men find
an instinctive satisfaction in submission. Self-dependence stands
out as a virtue or an accomplishment precisely because most men
feel so utterly at sea without any loyalty, allegiance, or devotion.
Any one who has spent a summer at a <a name="page_117"><span
class="page">Page 117</span></a> boy's camp will recall the helplessness
of youngsters to mark out a program for themselves and to keep
themselves happy on the one afternoon when there was no official
program of play. Half the mischief performed on such occasions is
initiated by some boy with just a little more independence and
persuasiveness than the others. And it is not only among children
that there is evinced an almost pathetic bewilderment and unrest in
the absence of a leader. There is an equally pathetic and sometimes
dangerous attachment among adults to the first sign of leadership
that makes its appearance. The demoralizing authority of the ward
heeler is sometimes dependent on no more trustworthy an index of
real power than a booming voice, a rough <i>camaraderie</i>, and
a physically "big" personality. And there are, on the other hand,
instances where lack of leadership seemed to be the chief reason
why certain classes of labor were unable to make their demands
effective at a much earlier date than they did. In the first really
big strike in the telephone industry in Boston during the autumn
of 1918 success seems to have been chiefly due to the remarkable
leadership of one of the young women operators, a type of leadership
which seems to have appeared nowhere else in the telephone industry.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See the article by Wm. Hard in the <i>New Republic</i>,
May 3, 1919.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The instinct of submissiveness, as has been pointed out in connection
with the discussion of all the other of man's original tendencies,
is not only strong, but may find its outlets in attachment, both
to desirable and to undesirable persons or objects. Once aroused,
attachment and submission may become as stanch as they are blind.
The signs which arouse our loyalty may be and most frequently are
glaring rather than important. As Trotter phrases it:
</p>

<p class="include">
The rational basis of the relation [following a leader] is, however,
seen to be at any rate open to discussion when we consider the
qualities in a leader upon which his authority so often rests, for
there can be little doubt that their appeal is more generally to
instinct than to reason. In ordinary politics it must be admitted
that the gift of <a name="page_118"><span class="page">Page
118</span></a> public speaking is of more decisive value than anything
else. If a man is fluent, dextrous, and ready on the platform,
he possesses the one indispensable requisite for statesmanship;
if in addition he has the gift of moving deeply the emotions of
his hearers, his capacity for guiding the infinite complexities
of national life becomes undeniable. Experience has shown that no
exceptional degree of any other capacity is necessary to make a
successful leader. There need be no specially arduous training, no
great weight of knowledge, either of affairs or the human heart,
no receptiveness to new ideas, no outlook into reality.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Trotter, p. 116.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Though these be picturesquely exaggerated statements, they do indicate
the fact that the outward signs of leadership, of a conspicuously
emotional sort, may be more significant in determining the attachments
and loyalties of human beings, than are genuine marks of capacity
in the direction of political and social affairs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This pronounced tendency on the part of human beings to follow a
lead, and anybody's lead, as it were, has the most serious dangers.
It means that a man with qualities that sway men's emotions and stir
their imaginations can attach to himself the profoundest loyalties
for personal or class ends. The gifts of personal magnetism, of a
kindly voice, an air of confidence and calmness, exuberant vitality,
and a sensitivity to other people's feelings, along with some of the
genuine qualities of effective and expert control of men and affairs,
may be used by a demagogue as well as by a really devoted servant
of the popular good, by an Alcibiades as well as by a Garibaldi,
by a conquering Napoleon as well as by a Lincoln.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our instincts of following and submission, apart from education, are
as easily aroused by specious signs of social power and conspicuousness
as by signs of mental effectiveness and genuine altruistic interest.
The exploitation of these tendencies by selfish leaders is therefore
particularly easy. The large circulation of the "yellow press,"
the power in politics of the unscrupulous, the selfish, and the
second-rate, are symptoms of how men's natural tendency to follow
has been <a name="page_119"><span class="page">Page 119</span></a>
played upon in support of plans and ambitions which would not be
sanctioned by their reason. The genius for leadership has been
exhibited in criminal gangs, in conquests and in fanaticism, as well
as in the promotion of good government, of better labor conditions
and better education.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But progress in these last-named is dependent on the utilization
of men's submissiveness by leaders interested in the promotion
of desirable social enterprises. While men may be so easily led,
they are responsive to leadership in good directions as well as
bad. No great social movements, the freeing of slaves, the gaining
of universal suffrage, the bettering of factory conditions, freedom
of thought and action, could have gained headway if men had been
born unwilling to follow. There are (see chapter IX) ineradicable
differences in capacity between men, and if the uninformed and
the socially helpless could not be aroused to follow those great
both in mind and magnanimity, it is difficult to see how the lot
of mankind ever could have, or ever can improve. A good leader
may make men support, out of instinctive loyalty, purposes and
plans which, if they completely understood them, they would support
out of reason. Up to the present most people have been, and will
probably remain for a long time to come, too ill-educated or too
poorly endowed by nature to understand the bearings of the great
social movements in which they are involved. In consequence, it is
a matter of congratulation that their instinct of submission can
be utilized in the interests of their welfare which they frequently
not only do not know how to obtain, but do not understand. The
Roman populace, enchanted by Augustus, follow him to greatness,
without comprehending the imperial destiny which they are helping
to build. The barbarian hordes affectionately following the lead
of Charlemagne incidentally help to build the whole edifice of
European civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Men display qualities of leadership.</b> The obverse of man's
tendency to follow a lead is, of course, his tendency to take it.
Individuals tend to display persistently and conspicuously <a
name="page_120"><span class="page">Page 120</span></a> just those
qualities which will win them the allegiance of others.
</p>

<p class="include">
The instinct of self-display is manifested by many of the higher
social or gregarious animals.... Perhaps among mammals the horse
displays it most clearly. The muscles of all parts are strongly
innervated, the creature holds himself erect, his neck is arched,
his tail lifted, his motions become superfluously vigorous and
extensive, he lifts his hoofs high in air as he parades before
the eyes of his fellows.... Many children clearly exhibit this
instinct of self-display; before they can walk or talk the impulse
finds its satisfaction in the admiring gaze or plaudits of the
family circle as each new acquirement is practiced; a little later
it is still more clearly expressed by the frequently repeated command,
"See me do this," or "See how well I can do so and so"; and for
many a child more than half the delight of riding on a pony, of
wearing a new coat, consists in the satisfaction of this instinct,
and vanishes if there be no spectators.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall; <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 62-64.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Individuals thus instinctively love to stand out from their fellows,
to outdistance and outclass them. And the qualities of leadership
are not infrequently stimulated by this competition with others,
for place, power, distinction. To win the allegiance and loyal
affection of men means that one's own personality is enhanced;
one stands out as a man of affairs, a social or political leader,
a guide to others in action or thought. As has already been pointed
out, the qualities that will win the submission and loyalty of others
vary widely. In the case of one man it may be a charming smile and a
gift of saying striking and stirring rather than significant things.
In the case of another it may be his air of immense confidence,
restraint, and reserve. It may be brute force or a terrible earnestness;
it may even be, as in the case of certain religious reformers,
extraordinary gentleness. Garibaldi "inspired among men of the most
various temperaments love that nothing could shake, and devotion
that fell little short of idolatry." "He enjoyed the worship and
cast the spell of a legendary hero." Alcibiades charmed, despite
the patent evil he wrought, by his magical personal beauty and
grace. <a name="page_121"><span class="page">Page 121</span></a>
Vandamme said of Napoleon: "That devil of a man exercises on me a
fascination that I cannot explain to myself, and in such a degree
that, though I fear neither God nor devil, when I am in his presence
I am ready to tremble like a child, and he could make me go through
the eye of a needle to throw myself into the fire." Augereau is
stupefied at their first meeting, and confesses afterwards that
"this little devil of a general" has inspired him with awe.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See chapter XXI on "Personality" in Ross's <i>Social
Control</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Men's qualities of leadership depend, however, not only on their
personal charm, but on certain seeming or genuine symptoms of
effectiveness. Evidences of strong determination, of a sweeping
imagination, of calm, of confidence, of enthusiasm, of qualities
possessed by the vast majority only in minor degrees, win men's
admiration and devotion because they are associated with the ability
to accomplish great ends, to do the unusual, to succeed where most
people fail. Most men are so conscious of their limitations and
the difficulties of any enterprise which they undertake that at
any sign of exceptional talent, whether real or apparent, they
will commit their respect, their energies, and sometimes, as in
the case of a religious crusade, their lives.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For good or evil, the possession, the cultivation, and the exhibition
of the qualities of leadership give men enormous power. There was in
the nineteenth century a historical fashion, brilliantly exemplified
by Carlyle, to assume that history was made by great men. Latterly,
there has been wide dissent from this simplification of the processes
of history, but it is clear that innovations must be started by
individuals, and that a powerful leader is a matchless instrument
for initiating, and getting wide and enthusiastic support for changes,
whether good or bad. To quote Carlyle's eloquent exaggeration:
</p>

<p class="include">
For, as I take it, Universal History, the history of what man has
accomplished in this world, is at the bottom the History of the Great
Men who have worked here. They were the leaders of men, ... the <a
name="page_122"><span class="page">Page 122</span></a> creators of
whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to do or to attain; all
things that we see standing accomplished in the world are properly
the outer material result, the practical realization and embodiment,
of thoughts that dwelt in the Great Men sent into the world: the
soul of the whole world's history, it may justly be considered, was
the history of these.... Could we see <i>them</i> well, we should
get some glimpses into the very marrow of the world's history.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Carlyle: <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship</i>, Lecture I.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Later Nietzsche made much of this same idea, of the Superman striding
through the world and changing its destiny, although in Nietzsche
the Superman was an end in himself rather than the servant of the
world in which he lived.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To most historical writers to-day the forces at work in history are
much too complex to be dismissed with any such simple melodrama.
But there remain striking testimonies of the influence of leaders.
The sweep of Mohammedanism into Europe was initiated by the burning
and contagious zeal of one religious enthusiast. The campaign against
slavery in this country assumed large proportions through the strenuous
leadership of the Garrisons and the Wendell Phillipses. In our
own day we have seen the same phenomenon; the great political and
social changes of the last generation have all had their special
advocates and leaders who, if they were merely expressing the "spirit
of the times," yet did give that spirit expression. Every reform
or revolution has its leading spirits. That leadership is not the
one essential goes without saying; there have been great guides
of repeatedly lost causes. But many great causes may have been
lost through the want of good leadership.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In contemporary life leadership is not always directly personal, but
is carried on through the medium of the newspapers and periodicals.
But this merely means that a leader may reach a wider audience; he
reaches thousands through picture and print, instead of hundreds
by word of mouth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Qualities of leadership may be utilized in the support of the customary
or the established, as well as in initiation and <a
name="page_123"><span class="page">Page 123</span></a> support of
the novel. People ape the great, or those that pass for great, in
manners and morals. The words of a distinguished public man have
prestige in the maintenance of the established. Men <i>will</i>
follow, and if the socially conspicuous lead them along the ways
of the established, they will follow there as readily and, being
creatures of habit, often more readily than along new paths. The
immense following among the lower social classes that the Conservative
Party had in England all through the nineteenth century in the face
of proposed changes that would have bettered their own conditions,
is an interesting illustration of this. This is partly because
the influence of leaders is dependent on their social status as
well as their personal qualities. The opinions of inventors and
big business men are taken with eagerness and credulity even when
touching matters outside their own field. A man is made, as it
were, <i>ipso facto</i>, a leader, by being rich, powerful, of a
socially distinguished family, or the director of a large industry,
although he may have, besides, qualities of leadership that do not
depend on his social position.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Man pities and protects weak and suffering things.</b> Nearly
all human beings exhibit a tendency to protect weak and suffering
things. This impulse is closely related to, and probably has its
origin in the parental instinct, more common, of course, in women
than in men. The feeling of affectionate pity and the impulse to
rescue from pain are most intense when the distressed thing is a
child, and particularly one's own. One of the most poignant instances
extant is the speech of Andromache, one of the Trojan women in
Euripides's play of that name, to her child who is about to be slain
by the Greeks:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
And none to pity thee!... Thou little thing,<br />
That curlest in my arms, what sweet scents cling<br />
All round thy neck! Beloved; can it be<br />
All nothing, that this bosom cradled thee<br />
And fostered; all the weary nights wherethrough<br />
I watched upon thy sickness, till I grew<br />
Wasted with watching? Kiss me. This one time;<br />
Not ever again. Put up thine arms and climb<br />
<a name="page_124"><span class="page">Page 124</span></a>
About my neck; now kiss me, lips to lips...<br />
O ye have found an anguish that outstrips<br />
All tortures of the East, ye gentle Greeks!<br />
Why will ye slay this innocent that seeks<br />
No wrong?...[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Euripides: ''Trojan Women'' (Gilbert Murray translation),
p. 49.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the "tender emotion" as McDougall calls it, is aroused by other
children than one's own, and by others than children. It is called
out particularly by things that are by nature helpless and delicate,
but may be aroused by adults who are placed in situations where
they are suffering and powerless. Samson, shorn of his strength,
has been a traditional occasion for pathos. The sick, the bereaved,
the down-and-outers, the failures, the forlorn and broken-hearted,
call out in most men an impulse to befriend and protect. Those
who have been dealt with unjustly or severely by their associates
and society and who have no redress, the poverty-stricken, the
criminal who has been punished and remains an exile, the maimed
and deformed, the widow and orphan, all these, arouse, apart from
the restraining force exercised by other instincts and habits,
such as anger and disgust, a natural tendency to pity and aid.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The parental instinct in its direct and primitive form is responsible
for the closeness of family relations, a most important consideration
in the case of humans who have, as already discussed, a long period
of infancy during which they are absolutely dependent on their
elders. In the higher species, writes McDougall, "The protection and
cherishing of the young is the constant and all-absorbing occupation
of the mother, to which she devotes all her energies, and in the
course of which she will at any time undergo privation, pain, and
death. The instinct becomes more powerful than any other, and can
override any other, even fear itself."[2] Wherever the power of
the parental instinct has waned, as in Greek and Roman society,
the civilization in which that degeneration occurred was subjected
to rapid decay.[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_125"><span class="page">Page 125</span></a> The parental
instinct in its more general form of pity and protectiveness toward
all weak and suffering things is, in the minds of many moralists,
the origin of all altruistic sentiments and actions, and at the
same time the moral indignation which insists on the punishment
of wrong-doers. It is clearly apparent in such movements as the
Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or to Animals,
the antivivisection crusade, and the like. But according to such
a distinguished moralist as John Stuart Mill, the whole system
of justice and punishment has its origins in this tender feeling
for those who have been wronged.

<b>Fear.</b> Fear is one of the least specialized of human traits,
being called out in a great variety of situations, and resulting
in a great variety of responses. The most obvious symptom of fear
is flight, but there may be a dozen other responses. "Crouching,
clinging, starting, trembling, remaining stock still, covering the
eyes, opening the mouth and eyes, a temporary cessation followed by
an acceleration of the heart-beat, difficulty in breathing, paleness,
sweating, and erection of the hair are responses of which certain
ones seem bound, apart from training, to certain situations, such
as sudden loud noises or clutches, the sudden appearance of strange
objects, thunder and lightning, loneliness and the dark."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 20.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In general, the marked physical reactions and deep emotional disturbance
that we call fear are aroused by anything loud or strange, or that has
outward signs of possible danger to ourselves, such as a large wild
animal approaching us. In civilized man, whose life is comparatively
sheltered, there are considerable individual differences in
susceptibility to fear, and in the intensity with which it controls
the individual. But there are certain typical situations that call
it forth. Among young children, and not much less so among adults,
fear is aroused by any sudden loud noise, by strange men and strange
animals, black things and dark places, "vermin," such as spiders and
snakes, among a great many adults fear of <a name="page_126"><span
class="page">Page 126</span></a> high places, and, among a few
agaraphobia or fear of open spaces.[1] The deep-seatedness of fear
has been explained by the fact that most of the things which
instinctively arouse fear were, in primitive life, the source of
very real danger and that under those conditions, where it was
absolutely essential to beware of the unfamiliar and the strange,
only those animals survived who were equipped with such a protective
mechanism as fear provides.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: For a discussion of these, see James: <i>Psychology</i>,
vol. II, p. 415 ff.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The instinct of fear has important social consequences, especially
as its influence is not infrequently clothed over with reasons. In
savage life, as McDougall points out, "fear of physical punishment
inflicted by the anger of his fellows must have been the great agent
of discipline of primitive man; through such fear he must first
have learned to control and regulate his impulses in conformity
with the needs of social life."[2] In contemporary society fear is
not so explicitly present, but it is still a deep-seated power
over men's lives. Fear of punishment may not be the only reason
why citizens remain law-abiding, but it is an important control
over many of the less intelligent and the less socially minded. In
an unideal society there are still many who will do as much evil
as is "within the law," and fear of the consequences of failing
a course is among some contemporary undergraduates still an
indispensable stimulus of study.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 303.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Fear plays a part, however, not only in preventing people from
breaking the law, but often from living their lives freely and
after their own convictions. As has been strikingly pointed out
by Hilaire Belloc and Hobson, one of the greatest evils of our
present hit-or-miss methods of employment is the fear of "losing
his job," the uncomfortable feeling of insecurity often felt by the
workingman who, having so frequently nothing to store up against a
rainy day, lives in perpetual fear of sickness or discharge.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In earlier times fear of the consequences of expressing dissent
<a name="page_127"><span class="page">Page 127</span></a> from
established opinions and beliefs was one of the chief sources of
social inertia. Where excommunication, torture, and death followed
dissent, it is not surprising that men feared to be dissenters. In
contemporary society under normal conditions men have much less to
fear in the way of punishment, but may accept the traditional and
conventional because they fear the consequences of being different,
even if those consequences are not anything more serious than a
personal snub.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While men fear to dissent because of the disapproval to which they
may be subjected, dissent, the novel and strange in action and
opinion are themselves feared by most men because of the unknown
and unpredictable consequences to which they may lead. Men were
at first afraid of the steam-engine and the locomotive. Men still
fear novel political and social ideas before they can possibly
understand what they have to be afraid of. The fact that thought
so continually turns up the novel and the strange is, according
to Bertrand Russell, precisely the reason why most men are afraid
to think. And fear of the novel, the strange, the unaccustomed is,
as in the case of many other instincts, a perfectly natural means
of protection that would otherwise have to be sought by elaborate
processes of reason. In what we call prudence, caution, and care,
fear undoubtedly plays some part, and Plato long ago pointed out
it is only the fool, not the brave man, who is utterly unafraid.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: <i>Protagoras</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Psychologists may be said to differ largely as to the utility of
fear. They are nearly all agreed that in the forest life which was
man's originally, fear had its specific marked advantages. Open
spaces, dark caverns, loud noises were undoubtedly associated very
frequently with danger to the primitive savage, and an instinctive
recoil from these centers of disaster was undoubtedly of survival
value. But there is an increasing tendency to discount the utility
of fear in civilized life. "Many of the manifestations of fear
must be <a name="page_128"><span class="page">Page 128</span></a>
regarded as pathological, rather than useful.... A certain amount
of timidity obviously adapts us to the world we live in, but the
<i>fear paroxysm</i> is surely altogether harmful to him who is
its prey."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. II, p. 419.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Fear and worry, which is a continuous form of fear, in general
hinder action rather than promote it. In its extreme form it brings
about complete paralysis, as in the case of terror-stricken hunted
animals. When humans or animals are utterly terrified even death
may result. This fact that fear hinders action, sometimes most
seriously, seems to some philosophic writers, especially Bertrand
Russell, a key fact for social life. "No institution," he writes,
"inspired by fear, can further life."[2] And in another connection:
"In the world as we have been imagining it, economic fear will
be removed out of life.... No one will be haunted by the dread
of poverty.... The unsuccessful professional man will not live
in terror lest his children should sink in the scale.... In such
a world, most of the terrors that lurk in the background of men's
minds will no longer exist."[3] "In the daily lives of most men
and women, fear plays a <i>greater part than hope. It is not so
that life should be lived</i>."[4]

<b>Love and hate.</b> All human relations are qualified by the
presence, more or less intense, of emotion. Human beings are not
merely so many items that are coldly counted and handled, as one
counts and handles pounds of sugar and pieces of machinery. A man
may thus regard human beings when he deals with them in mass, or
thinks of them in statistical tables or in the routine of a government
office. But human beings experience some emotional accompaniment
in their dealings with individuals, especially when face to face,
and experience more especially, in varying degrees, the emotions
of love or hate. These terms are here used in the general sense
of the receptive, positive, or expansive attitude and the <a
name="page_129"><span class="page">Page 129</span></a> cold, negative,
repellent, and contractual attitude toward others. These may both
be intense and consciously noted, as in the case of long-cherished
and deep affections or antipathies to different individuals. They
may appear as a half-realized sense of pleasure in the mere presence
and poise of a person, or a curious sense of discomfort and irritation
at his appearance, his voice, or his gesture. These attitudes, even
when slight, color and qualify our relations with other individuals.
They may, in their larger manifestations, play so large a part,
that they must be considered separately, and in detail.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Love.</b> Love, used in this broad sense, varies in intensity.
It may be nothing more&mdash;it certainly frequently starts as
nothing more&mdash;than the feeling, so native as to be fairly called
instinctive, of common sympathy, fellow feeling, immediate affinity
with another. The psychological origins of this disposition have
already been noted in connection with man's tendency to experience
sympathetically immediately the emotions of others. Every business
man, lawyer, teacher, any one who comes much into contact with a
wide variety of people, knows how, antecedent to any experience
with an individual's capacities or talents, or even before one had
a chance to draw any inferences from a person's walk, his bearing,
or his clothing, one may register an immediate like or dislike.
Every one has had the experience in crossing a college campus or
riding in a train or street car of noting, in passing some one
whom one has never seen before, an immediate reaction of good-will
and affection. This has been charmingly expressed by a well-known
English poet:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And out we troop to see;<br />
&nbsp; A single redcoat turns his head,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He turns and looks at me.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"My man, from sky to sky's so far,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We never crossed before;<br />
&nbsp; Such leagues apart the world's ends are,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We're like to meet no more.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
<a name="page_130"><span class="page">Page 130</span></a>
"What thoughts at heart have you and I,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We cannot stop to tell;<br />
&nbsp; But dead or living, drunk or dry,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soldier, I wish you well."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: A. E. Housman: <i>The Shropshire Lad</i> (John Lane
edition), p. 32.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
All affection for individuals probably starts in this immediate
instinctive liking. "The first note that gives sociability a personal
quality and raises the comrade into an incipient friend is doubtless
sensuous affinity. Whatever reaction we may eventually make on
an impression, after it has had time to soak in and to merge in
some practical or intellectual habit, its first assault is always
on the senses; and no sense is an indifferent organ. Each has, so
to speak, its congenial rate of vibration, and gives its stimuli
a varying welcome. Little as we may attend to these instinctive
hospitalities of sense, they betray themselves in unjustified likes
and dislikes felt for casual persons and things, in the <i>je ne sais
quai</i> that makes instinctive sympathy."[2] From this immediate
instinctive liking it may rise to deep personal attachments, strikingly
manifested in friendship and love between the sexes, both immemorially
celebrated by poets and novelists. Love is aroused chiefly by persons,
and among persons, especially in the case of sexual love, most
frequently by more or less physical beauty and attractiveness.
But affection may be aroused and is certainly sustained by other
than merely physical qualities.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Santayana: <i>Reason in Society</i>, p. 151.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is provoked by what we call personal or social charm, a genuine
kindliness of manner, an open-handed sincerity and frankness,
considerateness, gentleness, whimsicality. Which particular social
graces will win our affections depends of course on our own interests,
equipment, and fund of instinctive and acquired sympathies. Popular
psychology has in various proverbs hit at and not entirely missed
some of the obvious and contradictory elements: "Opposites attract,"
"Birds of a feather flock together," and so on. Intellectual <a
name="page_131"><span class="page">Page 131</span></a> qualities,
in persons of marked intellectual interests, will also sustain
friendship and deepen an instinctive liking. Friendships thus begin
in accident and are continued through community of interest. It is
to be questioned whether merely striking intellectual qualities
initiate a friendship. They may command admiration and respect, but
liking, friendship, and love have a more emotional and personal
basis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This same warm affectionate appreciation that nearly all people have
for other persons, fewer people&mdash;great poets, philosophers, and
enthusiastic leaders of men&mdash;have for causes, institutions,
and ideas. One feels in the works of great thinkers the same warmth
and loyalty to ideas and causes that ordinary people display toward
their friends. Plato has given for all time the progress of love
from attachment to a single individual through to institutions,
ideas, and what he called mystically the idea of beauty itself.
</p>

<p class="include">
For he who would proceed rightly in this matter should begin in
youth to turn to beautiful forms; and first, if his instructor guide
him rightly, he should learn to love one such form only&mdash;out
of that he should create fair thoughts, and soon he will himself
perceive that the beauty of one form is truly related to the beauty
of another, and then if beauty in general is his pursuit, how foolish
would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is one
and the same! And when he perceives this he will abate his violent
love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing,
and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; this will lead
him on to consider that the beauty of the mind is more honorable
than the beauty of the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul
have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend
him... until his beloved is compelled to contemplate and see the
beauty of institutions and laws, and understand that all is of
one kindred; and that personal beauty is only a trifle; and after
laws and institutions, he will lead him on to the sciences, that he
may see their beauty... until at length he grows and waxes strong,
and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science which
is the science of beauty everywhere.[l]

There have been again great scientists who have had the same warm
affectionate devotion for their subject-matter <a name="page_132"><span
class="page">Page 132</span></a> that most men display toward persons.
There are scholars almost literally in love with their subjects.
There have been a greater number whose capacity for affection has
extended to include the whole human race, and, indeed, all animate
creation. Such a type of character is beautifully exemplified in
Saint Francis of Assisi:
</p>

<p class="include">
In Francis all living creatures may truly be said to have found
a friend and benefactor; his great heart embraced all the men and
women who sought his sympathy and advice, and his pity for the
dumb helplessness of suffering animals was deep and true. He would
lift the worm from his path lest a careless foot should crush it,
and would encourage his "little sister grasshopper" to perch upon
his hand, and chirp her song to his gentle ear. He tamed the fierce
wolf of Gubbio, and fed the robins with crumbs from his table.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Goff and Kerr-Lawson: <i>Assisi of Saint Francis</i>,
p. 121.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
And Christ stands, of course, in the Christian world, as the supreme
symbol of love for mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In ordinary men it is this generalized affection which is at the
basis of any sustained interest in philanthropic or altruistic
enterprises. No less than a large and generous affection for humanity
is required to enable men to endure for long the dreariness and
disillusion so often incident to philanthropic work, the conflicts
and disappointments of public administration. Certainly this is
true of the first rank of statesmen; no characterization of Lincoln
fails to emphasize his essential humanity and tenderness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Disinterested love for humanity is normally most intense in the
adolescent.[2] The pressure of private concerns, of one's narrowing
interest in one's own career, one's own family, and small circle
of friends, the restriction of one's sympathies by fixed habits
and circumscribed experience, all tend to dampen by middle age the
ardor of the man who as an undergraduate at eighteen set out to
make the world "a better place to live in." But more effective in
dampening enthusiasm is the disillusion and weariness that set in
after a period of exuberant <a name="page_133"><span class="page">Page
133</span></a> and romantic benevolence to mankind in general.
"We call pessimists," writes a contemporary French philosopher,
"those who are in reality only disillusioned optimists."[1] So the
cynic may be fairly described as a disheartened lover of men. It is
only an unusual gift of affectionate good-will that enables mature
men, after rough and disillusioning experiences in public life, to
maintain without sentimentality a genuine and persistent interest
in the welfare of others. Those in whom the fund of human kindness
is slender will, and easily do, become cynical and hard.
</p>

man is interested in causes; at twenty-eight in commutation tickets."]

<p class="indent">
The attitude of affection for others is profoundly influential in
stimulating our interest in specific individuals, and modifying
our attitudes toward them. We cannot help being more interested
in those for whom we entertain affection than in those to whom we
are indifferent. In the same way our judgments of our own friends,
families, and children are qualified by our affection for them.
Parents and lovers are notoriously partial, and a fair judgment
of the work of our friends demands unusual clarity, determination,
and poise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In a larger way the generally friendly attitude towards others,
genial expansive receptivity, is at the basis of what is called
"charity for human weakness." The gentle cynic can see and tolerate
other men's weaknesses:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"He knows how much of what men paint themselves<br />
&nbsp; Would blister in the light of what they are;<br />
&nbsp; He sees how much of what was great now shares<br />
&nbsp; An eminence transformed and ordinary;<br />
&nbsp; He knows too much of what the world has hushed<br />
&nbsp; In others, to be loud now for himself."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Edwin Arlington Robinson: "Ben Jonson Entertains a
Man from Stratford," in his <i>Man Against the Sky</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The devoutly religious have displayed keen psychological insight
when they made man's salvation dependent on God's charity, and
identified, as did Dante, charity with love.[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: "Love and the gentle heart are one and the same thing."
<i>The New Life</i>. XX (son XI) <i>Amore e cor gentile son una
cosa.</i> To Dante the spontaneous impulse to love is the basis
of all altruism. To feel and to follow this impulse is to be truly
noble, to have a "<i>cor gentile</i>," a gentle heart.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_134"><span class="page">Page 134</span></a> <b>Hate.</b>
Hate may be described as an extreme form of disaffection usually
provoked by some marked interference with our activities, desires,
or ideals. But in less intense degree the negative feeling towards
others may be provoked immediately and unmistakably by most casual
evidence of voice, manner, or bearing. Such immediate revulsions of
feeling contrast with the instances of "instinctive sympathy" previously
cited, and are as direct and uncontrollable. Even kindly disposed
persons cannot help experiencing in the presence of some persons
they have never seen before, a half-conscious thrill of repulsion
or a dislike colored with dread. A shifting gaze, a noticeably
pretentious manner, a marked obsequiousness, a grating voice, a
chillness of demeanor, a physical deformity, these, however little
they may have to do with a person's genuine qualities, do affect
our attitudes toward them. As the familiar verse has it:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
 "I do not like you, Dr. Fell,<br />
&nbsp; The reason why I cannot tell,<br />
&nbsp; But this I know, and know full well,<br />
&nbsp; I do not like you, Dr. Fell."
</p>

<p class="indent">
We may later revise our estimates, but the initial reaction is
made, and often remains as a subconscious qualification of our
general attitude toward another. People of worldly experience learn
to trust their first reactions, to "size a man up" almost intuitively,
and to be surprised if their first impressions go astray.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From this merely instinctive revulsion the negative attitude may
rise to that terrible form of destructive antipathy which is "hate,"
as popularly understood. In between lie degrees of dislike depending
partly on the strength of the initial antipathy, but equally so
on the degree to which others, whether persons, institutions, or
ideas, interfere with our activities, desires, or ideals. The man
who seriously obstructs our love, our pleasure, or our ambition, or
who tries to do so, provokes hate, and its concomitants of jealousy,
rage, and pugnacity. It is not only that we dislike the mere presence
<a name="page_135"><span class="page">Page 135</span></a> of the
person (in the opposite case the mere presence of the beloved object
is a joy), but we dislike it for what it portends in danger and
threat to ourselves. The more serious the evil or disaster for
which a person comes to stand, the more violent the hatred for him,
despite his personal fascinations. The villain is not infrequently
a "damned smiling villain."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The provocation of hate is complicated by the fact that it is closely
associated with fear. We dislike those who threaten our happiness
partly because we fear them. And we fear, as was pointed out in more
detail in the discussion of that powerful human trait, the unfamiliar,
the strange, the startling, the unexpected. The facility with which
sensational newspapers can work up in an ignorant population a hate
for foreign nations, especially those of a totally alien civilization,
is made possible by the fear which these uninformed readers can
feel at the dangerous possibilities of mysterious foreign hordes.
The fomenting of fear is in nearly all such cases a prerequisite to
the fomenting of hate. And the promotion of hate has historically
been one of the frequent ingredients of international conflicts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Like love, hate is profoundly influential in modifying our interest
in persons and situations. To dislike a person moderately is, in his
absence, to be indifferent to him. To dislike him intensely, in a
sense increases our interest in him, though perversely. Just as we
wish the beloved person to succeed, to gain honor and reputation and
wealth, so we long for and rejoice in the downfall and discomfiture
of our enemies. Thus writes the Psalmist:
</p>

<p class="include">
Arise, O Lord, save me, my God; for thou has smitten all mine enemies
upon the cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly....
</p>

<p class="include">
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that I might destroy
those that hate me.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Hate may be directed against persons, and usually it is. But hatred
may be directed against institutions and ideas as well. For many
persons it will be impossible for a decade to <a name="page_136"><span
class="page">Page 136</span></a> listen to German music or the
German language, so closely have these become associated in their
minds with ideas and practices which they detest. To a dogmatic
Calvinist in the sixteenth century, both an heretical creed and
its practitioners, were objects of abomination. Disappointed men
may take out in a spleen and hatred of mankind their personal pique
and balked desires.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Great hates may be present at the same time and in the same persons
as great loves. Indeed for some persons strength in the one passion
is impossible without a corresponding strength in its opposite.
We cannot help hating, more or less, not only those who interfere
with our own welfare, but with the welfare of those who, being dear
to us, have become, as we say, a part of our lives. Thus writes
Bertrand Russell in the introduction to his treatment of some of
the radical social tendencies of our own day:
</p>

<p class="include">
Whatever bitterness or hate may be found in the movements which
we are to examine, it is not bitterness or hate, but love, that
is their mainspring. It is difficult not to hate those who torture
the objects of our love. Though difficult, it is not impossible;
but it requires a breadth of outlook, and a comprehensiveness of
understanding which are not easy to preserve amid a desperate
contest.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Russell: <i>Proposed Roads to Freedom</i>, pp. xvii-xviii.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Hate may thus be, as great religious and social reformers illustrate,
invoked on the side of good as well as evil. The prophets burned
with a "righteous indignation." But hate is a violent and consuming
passion, bent on destroying obstacles rather than solving problems.
It consumes in hatred for individuals such energy as might more
expeditiously be devoted to the improvement of the circumstances
which make people do the mean or small or blind actions which arouse
our wrath. The complete meekness and humility preached by Christ
have not been taken literally by the natively pugnacious peoples
of Europe. But as James says suggestively:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_137"><span class="page">Page 137</span></a> "Love
your enemies!" Mark you not simply those who do not happen to be
your friends, but your <i>enemies</i>, your positive and active
enemies. Either this is a mere Oriental hyperbole, a bit of verbal
extravagance, meaning only that we should, in so far as we can,
abate our animosities, or else it is sincere and literal. Outside
of certain cases of intimate individual relation, it seldom has
been taken literally. Yet it makes one ask the question: Can there
in general be a level of emotion so unifying, so obliterative of
differences between man and man, that even enmity may come to be an
irrelevant circumstance and fail to inhibit the friendlier interests
aroused. If positive well-wishing could attain so supreme a degree of
excitement, those who were swayed by it might well seem superhuman
beings. Their life would be morally discrete from the lives of
other men, and there is no saying... what the effects might be:
they might conceivably transform the world.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, p.
283.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Dislikes, disagreements, native antipathies are not to be abolished,
human differences being ineradicable and human interests, even in
an ideal society, being in conflict. But a keener appreciation
of other viewpoints, which is possible through education, a less
violent concern with one's own personal interests to the exclusion
of all others, may greatly reduce the amount of hate current in
the world, and free men's energies in passions more positive in
their fruits.

CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE DEMAND FOR PRIVACY AND INDIVIDUALITY</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Privacy and solitude.</b> Although one of man's most powerful
tendencies, as has already been pointed out, is his desire to be
with his fellows, this desire is not unqualified. Just as men can be
satiated with too much eating, and irritated by too much inactivity,
so men become "fed up" with companionship. The demand for solitude
and privacy is thus fundamentally a physiological demand, like the
demand for rest. "The world is too much with us," especially the
human world. Companionship, even of the most desirable kind, exhausts
nervous energy, and may become positively fatiguing and painful.
To crave solitude is thus not a sign of man's unsociability, but
a sign merely that sociability, like any other human tendency,
becomes annoying, if too long or too strenuously indulged. Much of
the neurasthenia of city life has been attributed to the continual
contact with other people, and the total inability of most city
dwellers to secure privacy for any considerable length of time. In
some people a lifelong habit of close contact with large numbers
of people makes them abnormally gregarious, so that solitude, the
normal method of recuperation from companionship, becomes unbearable.
Few city dwellers have not felt after a period of isolation in some
remote country place the need for the social stimulus of the city.
But a normal human life demands a certain proportion of solitude
just as much as it demands the companionship of others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
With the spread of education and the general enhancement of the
sense of personal selfhood and individuality among large numbers
of people, the demand for privacy has increased. The modern reader
is shocked to discover in the literature of the Elizabethan period
the amazing lack of a <a name="page_139"><span class="page">Page
139</span></a> sense of privacy there exhibited. In contemporary
society this sense and the possibility of its satisfaction are
variously displayed on different economic and social levels. In
the congested life of the tenements it is almost impossible, and
many social evils are to be traced to the promiscuous mingling of
large families (and sometimes additional boarders) in congested
quarters.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The demand for privacy and solitude becomes acute among people
who do a great deal of mental work. "Man," says Nietzsche, "cannot
think in a herd," and the thinker has traditionally been pictured
as a solitary man. This is because quiet seems to be, for most men,
an essential condition of really creative thought. There are some
men who find it impossible to write when there is another person,
even one of whom they are fond, in the same room. "No man," writes
Mr. Graham Wallas, "is likely to produce creative thoughts (either
consciously or subconsciously) if he is constantly interrupted by
irregular noises." Constant association with other people means,
moreover, continual distraction by conversation which seriously
interrupts a consecutive train of thought. The insistence in public
and college reading rooms on absolute quiet is a device for securing
as nearly as may be privacy in intellectual work.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Privacy is again demanded as a matter of emotional protection in
individuals in whom there is a highly sensitive development of
personal selfhood. We like to keep our concerns to ourselves, or
to share them only with those with whom we have a marked community
of interest and feeling. Children love to "have secrets they won't
tell," and older people, especially sensitive and intelligent ones,
feel a peculiar sense of irritation at having their personal affairs
and feelings publicly displayed. Nearly everyone must recall occasions
where he was vividly communicative and loquacious with a friend,
only to relapse into a clam-like silence on the entry of a third
person. This is primarily due to the fact that while men are by
nature gregarious, their gregariousness early becomes specialized <a
name="page_140"><span class="page">Page 140</span></a> and aroused
exclusively by people for whom they develop a sense of personal
affection and common sympathy. Any intrusion from without this
circle becomes an intrusion upon privacy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Satisfaction in personal possession: the acquisitive instinct.</b>
An almost universal human trait of considerable social consequence
is the satisfaction men experience in having objects that are their
own. Both animals and humans, apart from training, display a tendency
to get and hold objects. This tendency may take extreme forms,
as in the case of miserliness or kleptomania. It is evidenced in
special ways in the collections that children, and some grown-ups,
make of miscellaneous objects without any particular use, and with
no particular &aelig;sthetic value.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The objects which satisfy this instinct of possession may include
material goods, family, or larger groups. In primitive tribes under
the patriarchal system, the patriarch practically owns the tribe.
Our laws not so long ago recognized the marriage relation as a
state in which the wife is possessed or owned by the husband.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Possession gives the owner various kinds of satisfaction. The
instinctive satisfaction in possession itself may be quite irrespective
of the values of the objects owned, and deprivation may be fiercely
resisted out of all proportion to the value of the objects. Especially
will this be the case if the object possessed has become surrounded
with other emotional attachments, so that an individual may be as
bitterly chagrined and piqued by being deprived of some slight
memoir or keepsake as of a large sum of money. In the same way
the fighting spirit of a whole tribe or nation may be aroused by
the invasion or seizure of a small and unimportant bit of land,
or by the chance of its possession.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The instinctive sense of satisfaction, as in the last mentioned case
is enhanced by the sense of importance which comes from possession,
and which enhances one's own individuality and personality. A man's
vast holdings in wealth, <a name="page_141"><span class="page">Page
141</span></a> land, factories, machinery, or private estates is,
in a sense, regarded by him as an extension of his personality.
He is confirmed in this impression because it is so regarded by
his neighbors and the whole social group. A great landowner is a
celebrity throughout the countryside, and, as Mr. Veblen points
out, a large part of the luxurious display and expenditure of the
leisure classes is their way of publicly and conspicuously indicating
the amount of their possessions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As in the case of any other strong native tendency, interference
with the instinct of acquisition, whether displayed by the individual
or the group, provokes often fierce anger and bitter combat. The
history of wars of aggrandizement throughout the history of Europe
are testimonies to the efficacy of this instinct at least in the
initiation of war.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The progress of civilization beyond its earliest states is held,
by some sociologists and economists, to be ascribed to the power
of the acquisitive instinct. The acquisition of material wealth
or capital, the development of the institution of private property
with its concomitant individual development of land and natural
resources is maintained by Lester Ward to be of paramount importance
in social advance:
</p>

<p class="include">
... Objects of desire multiplied themselves and their possession
became an end of effort. Slowly the notion of property came into
being and in acquiring this, as history shows, the larger share of
all human energy has been absorbed. The ruling passion has for a
time long anterior to any recorded annals always been proprietary
acquisition.... Both the passion and the means of satisfying it
were conditions to the development of society itself, and rightly
viewed they have also been leading factors in civilization.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Lester Ward: <i>The Psychic Factors of Civilization</i>,
p. 156.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are many other motives to activity than acquisition, but there
are many evidences of its intense operation even in modern society.
Many men go on working long after they have money enough to enable
them to live in comfort, merely for the further satisfaction of this
impulse. "While in the course of satisfaction of most other desires,
the point of satiety <a name="page_142"><span class="page">Page
142</span></a> is soon reached, the demands of this one grow greater
without limit, so that it knows no satiety."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 323.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The power of this tendency to personal acquisition and possession
seems an obstacle to all thoroughly communistic forms of political
and social organization. The conception of a state where nobody
owns anything, but where all is owned in common&mdash;an idea which
has been repeated in many modern forms of socialism and communism,
fails to note this powerful human difficulty. Many socialist writers,
it must be noted, however, point out that they wish social ownership
of the means of production rather than of every item of personal
property, such as books, clothing, and the like.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Individuality in opinion and belief.</b> Men frequently display
with regard to their opinions and beliefs the same passionate attachment
that they exhibit with regard to their physical possessions. Like
the latter, these come to be regarded as an extension of the
individual's personality, and the same tenacious defense may be
made of them as of a house, land, or money.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Individual opinions and beliefs are not themselves possessions,
from a social point of view, so much as is the right to express
them. A man's private opinion may influence his own conduct; his
conduct itself may be an expression of opinion. But unless an opinion
is communicated, it cannot influence any one else's conduct, and
society has never been much concerned about opinions that an individual
harbored strictly in his own bosom. Silence, socially, is as good as
assent. The insistence on the right to one's own opinions becomes,
therefore, an insistence on the right or the freedom to express
them.[2] This right is cherished in varying degrees by different
individuals in different ages. It becomes pronounced in persons in
whom there is marked development of individuality, and, in general,
where, as in Anglo-Saxon <a name="page_143"><span class="page">Page
143</span></a> countries, a social and political tradition of liberty
and individuality has become very powerful.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Beliefs and opinions may come to be regarded as important
personal possessions in themselves, as in the case of rival claimants
to some theory or idea, as in the case of Leibnitz's and Newton's
dispute over the calculus.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Individuality in opinion and belief becomes critical chiefly when the
opinions and beliefs expressed are at variance with those generally
current among the group. For reasons already discussed in connection
with man's instinctive gregariousness and the emotional sway which
habits of thought have over men, dissent is regarded with suspicion.
Especially is this the case where the dissenting opinions have
to do with new social organization and custom. The psychological
causes of this opposition are various, but include among other
things a positive feeling of fear.
</p>

<p class="include">
It is only recently that men have been abandoning the belief that
the welfare of a state depends on rigid stability and on the
preservation of its traditions and institutions unchanged. Wherever
that belief prevails, novel opinions are felt to be dangerous as
well as annoying, and any one who asks inconvenient questions about
the why and the wherefore of accepted principles is considered a
pestilent person.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bury: <i>History of Freedom of Thought</i>, p. 9.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Throughout history there has been a long struggle for freedom of
thought and discussion, and there have been great landmarks in the
degree with which freedom was attained, and the fields wherein it
was permitted. For a long time in the history of Europe, dissent
from the prevailing opinion on religious matters was regarded both
as abominable and socially dangerous, and was severely punished.
Since the middle of the nineteenth century there has been no legal
punishment provided for dissent from established opinions in religion,
although penalties for heterodoxy in countries where religious
opinion is strong and fairly unanimous may be exerted in other
ways. In social matters also, there has practically ceased to be
legal coercion of opinion.[2] The argument for the suppression
of individual opinion has been tersely summarized by the author
above quoted:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Except in the recent period of excitement and stress
during the Great War, when suppression of opinion was, for better
or for worse, taken as a measure of national defense.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_144"><span class="page">Page 144</span></a> Those
who have the responsibility of governing a society can argue that
it is incumbent on them to prohibit the circulation of pernicious
opinions as to prohibit any anti-social actions. They can argue that
a man may do far more harm by propagating anti-social doctrines than
by stealing his neighbor's horse or making love to his neighbor's
wife. They are responsible for the welfare of the State, and if
they are convinced that an opinion is dangerous... it is their
duty to protect society against it as against any other danger.[1]

</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The social importance of individuality in opinion.</b> There
have been many notable documents in support of the belief that
society is the gainer and not the loser by permitting and encouraging
individuality in thought and belief. The following, taken from
one of the most famous of these, John Stuart Mill's <i>Essay on
Liberty</i>, was written to illustrate the fatal results of prohibiting
dissenting opinions merely because most people think or call them
immoral:
</p>

<p class="include">
Mankind can hardly be too often reminded that there was once a
man named Socrates, between whom and the legal authorities and
public opinion of his time there took place a memorable collision.
Born in an age and country abounding in individual greatness, this
man has been handed down to us by those who best knew both him
and the age, as the most virtuous man in it.... This acknowledged
master of all the eminent thinkers who have since lived&mdash;whose
fame, still growing after two thousand years, all but outweighs
the whole remainder of the names which make his native city
illustrious&mdash;was put to death by his countrymen, after a judicial
conviction, for impiety and immorality. Impiety, in denying the gods
recognized by the State.... Immorality, in being, by his doctrines
and instructions, a "corrupter of youth." Of these charges the
tribunal, there is every ground for believing, honestly found him
guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all then born had
deserved best of mankind to be put to death as a criminal.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: J. S. Mill: <i>Essay on Liberty</i>, chap. II.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every important step in human progress has been a variation from
the normal or accustomed, something new. Most advances in science
have been departures from older and accustomed ways of thinking.
Through the permission and encouragement of individual variation
in opinion we may <a name="page_145"><span class="page">Page
145</span></a> discover in the first place that accepted beliefs
are wrong. Galileo thought differently from the accepted Ptolemaic
astronomy of his day, and the demonstration of his diverging belief
proved the Ptolemaic astronomy to be wrong. The evolutionary theory,
bitterly attacked in its day, replaced Cuvier's doctrine of the
forms of life upon earth coming about through a series of successive
catastrophes. Lyell, in the face of the whole scientific world of
his day, insisted on the gradual and uniform development of the
earth's surface. Half the scientific doctrines now accepted as
axiomatic were bitterly denounced when they were first suggested
by an inquiring minority.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Milton in his famous <i>Areopagitica</i>, an address to Parliament
written in 1644, protesting against the censorship of printing,
stressed the importance of permitting liberty for the securing
and developing of new ideas:
</p>

<p class="include">
What should ye do then, should ye suppress all this flowery crop
of knowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing daily in
this city? Should ye set an oligarchy of twenty engrossers [censors]
over it, to bring a famine upon our minds again, when we shall
know nothing but what is measured us by their bushel? ... That
our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts more erected to
the search and expectation of greatest and exactest things, is
the issue of your own virtue propagated in us; ye cannot suppress
that unless ye re&euml;nforce an abrogated and merciless law....
Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according
to conscience, above all liberties.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Milton: <i>Areopagitica</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even if the currently accepted doctrines prove to be true, there
is, as Mill pointed out, a vast social utility in permitting the
expression of contrary opinion though it be an error. New ideas,
however extreme, "may and commonly do possess some portion of truth";
they bring to light and emphasize some aspect or point of view which
prevailing theories fail to note. Thus the possible over-emphasis of
certain contemporary writers on the socialization of man's life is
a valuable corrective to the equal over-emphasis on individualism
which was current among so many thinkers during the nineteenth <a
name="page_146"><span class="page">Page 146</span></a> century. The
insistence with which present-day psychologists call our attention
to the power of instinct, though it may possibly be over-emphasized,
counterbalances that tendency exhibited by such earlier authors
as Bentham to picture man as a purely rational being, whose every
action was determined by sheer logic.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Finally, unless doctrines are subjected to criticism and inquiry,
no matter how beneficial they are to society, they will become
merely futile and empty formul&aelig; with very little beyond a
mechanical influence on people's lives. The maxims of conventional
morality and religion which everybody believes and few practice are
solemnly bandied about with little comprehension of their meaning
and no tendency to act upon them. A belief becomes, as Mill pointed
out, living, vital, and influential in the clash of controversy.
Whether novel and dissenting doctrines are true or false, therefore,
the encouragement of their expression provides vitality and variation
without which progress is not possible.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The social appreciation of persons who display marked individual
opinions varies in different ages toward the same individual. The
martyr stoned to death by one generation becomes the hero and prophet
of the next. One has but to look back at the contemporary vilification
and ridicule to which Lincoln was subjected to find an illustration.
Or, on a more monumental scale:
</p>

<p class="include">
The event which took place on Calvary rather more than eighteen
hundred years ago. The man who left on the memory of those who
witnessed his life and conversation such an impression of his moral
grandeur that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to
him as the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death,
as what? As a blasphemer.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Essay on Liberty</i>, chap. II.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
One would suppose that men would have learned not only to tolerate
and be receptive to novelty in belief after these repeatedly tardy
recognitions of greatness. There are dozens of instances in the
history of religious, social, and political <a name="page_147"><span
class="page">Page 147</span></a> belief, of men and women who,
suppressed with the bitterest cruelty in one generation, have been
in effect, and sometimes in fact, canonized by posterity. And a
certain degree of tolerance and receptiveness has come to be the
result. But while we no longer burn religious and social heretics,
condemnation is still meted out in some form of ostracism. Prejudice,
custom, and special interest frequently move men to suppress in
milder ways extremists, expression of whose opinions seems to them,
as unusual opinions have frequently seemed, fraught only with the
greatest of harm.

CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE "SELF"</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Origin and development of a sense of personal selfhood.</b>
The expression of individuality in opinion is only one way men
have of expressing their personality, individuality, or self. From
the beginnings of childhood, men experience an increasing sense of
"personal selfhood" which finds various outlets in action or thought.
So familiar, indeed, in the normal man is his realization that he is
a "self," that it seldom occurs to him that this conception was an
attainment gradually accomplished through long years of experience
with the world about him. The very young baby does not distinguish
between Itself and the Not-Self which constitutes the remainder
of the universe. It is nothing but a stream of experiences, of
moment to moment pulsations of desire, of hunger and satisfaction,
of bodily comfort and bodily pain. As it grows older, it begins
dimly to distinguish between Itself and Everything-Else; it finds
itself to be something different, more vivid, more personal and
interesting than the chairs and tables, the crib and bottle, the
faces and hands, the smiles and rattles that are its familiar setting.
It discovers that "I am I," and that everything else ministers to
or frustrates or remains indifferent to its desires. It becomes a
person rather than a bundle of reactions. It develops a consciousness
of "self."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In its simplest form this consciousness of self is nothing more than
a continuous stream of inner organic sensations, and the constant
process of the body and limbs "and the special interest of these as
the seat of various pleasures and pains." This is what James calls
the "bodily self." As it grows older, the baby distinguishes between
persons and things. And as, in setting off his own body from other
things, <a name="page_149"><span class="page">Page 149</span></a>
it discovers its "bodily self," so in setting off its own opinions,
actions, and thoughts from other people, it discovers its "social
self." It is because Nature does in some degree the "giftie gie
us to see ourselves as others see us," that we do discover our
"selves" at all. "The normal human being, if it were possible for
him to grow up from birth onward in a purely physical environment,
deprived, that is, to say, of both animal and human companionship,
would develop but a very crude and rudimentary idea of the self."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: McDougall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 183.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The social self.</b> A man's social self, that is, his consciousness
of himself as set over against all the other individuals with whom
he comes in contact, develops as his relations with other people
grow more complex and various. A man's self, apart from his mere
physical body, consists in his peculiar organization of instincts
and habits. In common language this constitutes his personality
or character. We can infer from it what he will, as we say,
characteristically do in any given situation. And a particular
organization of instincts and habits is dependent very largely
on the individual's social experience, on the types and varieties
of contact with other people that he has established. There will
be differences, it goes without saying, that depend on initial
differences in native capacity. But both the consciousness of self
and the overt organization of instinctive and habitual actions
are dependent primarily on the groups with which an individual
comes in contact. In the formation of habits, both of action and
thought, the individual is affected, as we have seen, largely by
praise and blame. He very early comes to detect signs of approval
and disapproval, and both his consciousness of his individuality
and the character of that individuality are, in the case of most
persons, largely determined by these outward signs of the praise
and blame of others. And since, in normal experience, a man comes
into contact with several distinct groups, with varying codes of
conduct, he will really have a number of distinct personalities.
The professor is a <a name="page_150"><span class="page">Page
150</span></a> different man in his class and at his club; the
judge displays a different character in the court and in the bosom
of his family.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The self that comes to be most characteristic and distinctive of
a man, however, is determined by the group with which he comes
most habitually in contact, or to whose approvals he has become
most sensitive. Thus there develop certain typical personalities
or characters, such as those of the typical lawyer or soldier or
judge. Their bearing, action, and consciousness of self are determined
by the approvals and disapprovals of the group to which they are
most completely and intimately exposed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both the consciousness of self which most men experience and the
overt expression of that selfhood in act are thus seen to be a
more or less direct reflex of the praise and blame of the groups
with which they are in contact. Men learn from experience with
the praise and blame of others to "place" themselves socially, to
discover in the mirror of other men's opinions the status and locus
of their own lives. As we shall see in a succeeding section, the
degree of satisfaction which men experience in their consciousness
of themselves is dependent intimately on the praise and blame by
which their selfhood is, in the first place, largely determined.
In the chapter on the "Social Nature of Man," we examined in some
detail the way in which praise and blame modified a man's habits.
The total result of this process is to give a man a certain fixed
set of overt habits that constitute his character and a more or
less fixed consciousness of that character.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the other hand, a man's character and self-consciousness may
develop more or less independently of the immediate forces of the
public opinion to which he is exposed. One comes in contact in
the course of his experience not merely with his immediate
contemporaries, but with a wide variety of moral traditions. Except
in the rigidly custom-bound life of primitive societies, a man is,
even in practical life, exposed to a diversity of codes, standards,
and expectations of behavior. His family, his professional, his
political, and his social <a name="page_151"><span class="page">Page
151</span></a> groups expose him to various kinds of emphases and
accent in behavior. And a man of some intelligence, education,
and culture may be determined in his action by standards whose
origin is remote in time, space, and intention from those operative
in the predominant public opinion of his day. He may come to act
habitually on the basis of ideal standards which he has himself
set up through reflection, or which he has acquired from some moral
system or tradition, far in advance of those which are the staple
determinants of character for most of his contemporaries. He may
be one of those rare moral geniuses, singularly unsusceptible to
praise and blame, who create a new ideal of character by the dominant
individuality of their own. Or, as more frequently happens, he may
follow the ideals set up by such a one, instead of accepting the
orthodoxies which are generally observed. He may follow Christ
instead of the Pharisees, Socrates instead of the habit-crusted
citizens of Athens. We are, indeed, inclined to think of a man as
a peculiarly distinctive personality, when his sense of selfhood,
and the overt actions in which that selfhood finds expression,
are not determined by the current dogmas of his day, but by ideal
standards to which he has reflectively given allegiance. But so
much is the self, both in its consciousness and expression, socially
produced that men acting on purely imagined ideal standards, current
nowhere in their day and generation, have imagined a group, no
matter how small or how remote, who would praise them or a God who
noted and approved their ways.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Character and will.</b> From the foregoing it would appear that
the self is an organization of habitual tendencies, developed primarily
through contact with other people and more specifically through
their praise and blame. And consciousness of self is the awareness
of the unique or specific character of the habit-organization one
has acquired. Individuals differ natively in given capacities, and
differences in fully developed personalities depend, certainly
in part, on innate initial differences. But differences in the
kinds of selfhood <a name="page_152"><span class="page">Page
152</span></a> displayed and experienced by different men are due
to something more than differences in native capacities and native
desires. The self that a man exhibits and of which he is conscious,
at any given period of his life, depends on the complex system
of habits he has in the course of his experience developed. One
individual may, as we have seen, develop a number of sets of organized
dispositions, a multiple character, as it were, as a consequence
of the multiplicity of groups with which he has come in contact.
But whether through deliberate or habitual conformity to one group
as a norm, or the deliberate organization of habits of action and
feeling and thought, on the basis of ideal or reflective standards,
a man comes to develop a more or less "permanent self." That is,
while men start with somewhat similar native equipments, each man's
set of inborn tendencies comes to be fixed in a fairly definite
and specific system. While all men start within limits equally
responsive and similarly responsive to all stimuli, certain stimuli
come to have the "right of way." They are more or less easily and
more or less readily responded to, according as they do or as they
do not fit in with the habit-organization which the individual
has previously acquired.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When we say that a man has no character or individuality, we mean
that he has developed no stable organization of actions, feelings,
and thoughts, with reference to which and by the predominant drive
of which his actions are determined. There is no particular system
of behavior which he has come consciously to identify as his person
or self; no interweaving of motives and stimuli by the persistent
momentum of which his conduct is controlled; no single group of stimuli
rather than another has, in his pulpy person, attained priority in
stimulating power. Such men are chameleons rather than characters.
Their actions do not flow from a selfhood or individuality at all;
they are merely the random results of the accidental situations
in which such men find themselves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The self exists, then, as a well-defined, systematic trend of behavior.
Impulses to action attain a certain order of priority <a
name="page_153"><span class="page">Page 153</span></a> in an
individual's conduct, and it is by the momentum of these primary
drives to action that his life is controlled. What is commonly
known as "will" is simply another name for the power and momentum
of a man's "personal self." Will exists not as a thing, but as a
process. To will an action means to identify it consciously with
one's permanent self, to weigh and support it with all the emotions
and energies connected with one's consciously realized habitual
system of behavior. A man may bring to bear on the accomplishment
of a given action the deepest and most powerful motive forces of
his developed personality. To pass a course or make a team a student
may marshal all the habits of loyalty, of self-assertion (and the
emotional energies associated with them) which have become the
leading ingredients of his character.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The "permanent self" becomes involved in the same way in the case
of willing <i>not</i> to perform a certain action. Any stimulus may,
on occasion, be strong even if it has ceased to be characteristic
or habitual in a man's behavior. This is particularly the case with
some of the primary physical drives to action. Even the ascetic feels
the strong sting of sense-desire. A man in resisting temptation, in
denying the pressure of an immediate stimulus, is setting up to
block or inhibit it all the contrary reactions and emotions which
have become part of the "permanent self." In more familiar language
he is setting will over against desire. The temporary desire may
be strong, but it is consciously regarded by the individual as
alien to his "real" or "better" self. And <i>will</i> is this whole
complex organization of the permanent self set over against an
alien intruding impulse.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The phenomenon of will contending against desire occurs usually
when a stimulus not characteristically powerful in a man's conduct
becomes so through special conditions of excitement or fatigue.
When a man is tired, or stirred by violent emotion, his systematic
organization of habits begins to break down. The ideal permanent
or inclusive self is then brought into conflict with a temporary
passion. Love conflicts <a name="page_154"><span class="page">Page
154</span></a> with duty, the lower with the higher self, flesh with
spirit, desire with will. Few men have so thoroughly integrated
a self that such conflicts altogether cease. Every one carries
about with him a more or less divided soul.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
Fire and ice within me fight<br />
Beneath the suffocating night.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, in the records of abnormal psychology, many cases of
really divided personalities, cases of two or more completely separate
habit-organizations inhabiting the same physical body. Such a complete
Dr.-Jekyll-and-Mr.-Hyde dissociation of a personality is clearly
abnormal. But it is almost as rare to find a completely integrated
character. We are all of us more or less multiple personalities. Our
various personalities usually keep their place and do not interfere
with each other. Our professional and family selves may be different;
they do not always collide. But the various characters that we are
in various situations not infrequently do clash. The self whose
keynote is ambition or learning may conflict with the self whose
focus is love.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Resolve to be thyself; and know, that he<br />
&nbsp; Who finds himself, loses his misery!"
</p>

<p class="indent">
wrote Matthew Arnold. And it does seem to be true that a man whose
will is never divided or confused by contending currents of desire,
whose character is unified and whose action is consistent, is saved
from the perturbations, the confusions, the tossings of spirit
which possess less organized souls. But to find one's self, and
to keep one's self whole and undivided, is a difficult achievement
and a rare one. Even men whose interests and activities are fairly
well defined find their characters divided and their wills,
consequently, confused. A man's duties as a husband and father may
conflict with his professional ambitions; his love of adventure, with
his desire for wealth and social position; his artistic interests,
with his philanthropic activities; his business principles, with
his religious scruples. A man can achieve a selfhood by thrusting
<a name="page_155"><span class="page">Page 155</span></a> out all
interests save one, and achieving thereby unity at the expense of
breadth. There are men who choose to be, and succeed in being,
first and last, scholars or poets or musicians or doctors. All
activities, interests, and ideals that do not contribute to that
particular and exclusive self are practically negligible in their
conduct. Such men, although they have attained a permanent self,
have not achieved a broad, comprehensive, or inclusive one. They
are like instruments which can sound only one note, however clear
that may be; or like singers with only a single song. All lives
are necessarily finite and exclusive; every choice of an interest
or ideal very possibly precludes some other. A man cannot be all
things at once; "the philosopher and the lady-killer," as James
merrily remarks, "could not very well keep house in the same tenement
of clay." But a strong character need not necessarily mean a narrow
one, nor need a determined will be the will of a fanatic. The self
may be&mdash;in the case of rare geniuses it has been&mdash;diverse in
its interests, activities, and sympathies, yet unified and consistent
in action. A character may be various without being confused;
versatility is not synonymous with chaos. A man's interests and
activities may be given a certain order, rank, and proportion, so
that his life may exhibit at once the color, consistency, clarity,
and variety of a finished symphony.

<p class="indent">
The consciousness of "self" which starts as a mere continuum of
bodily sensations comes to be the net result of one's social and
intellectual as well as physical activities. The "self" of which
we are conscious ceases to be our merely physical person, and comes
to include our possessions. The house we live in and the garden
we tend, our children, our friends, our opinions, creations, or
inventions, these become extensions and more or less inalienable
parts of our personalities. Our "selfhood" includes not simply
us, but ours.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our possessions, and especially such as are the fruits of our own
actions, are indications of what we are. We judge, and within limits
correctly, of a man by the company he keeps, <a name="page_156"><span
class="page">Page 156</span></a> the clothes he wears, by the books
he reads, the pictures with which he decorates his home, the kind
of home he builds or has built. And a man may feel as provoked
by insult or injury to the person or things which have become an
intimate part of his life as if he were being attacked in his physical
person. Strip a man one by one of his physical acquisitions, of
his associates, of the indications and mementos of the things he
has thought and done, and there would be no "self" left. To speak
of a man as a nonentity is to imply that he is no "self" worth
speaking of; that he can be blown about hither and thither; that
neither his opinions nor desires, nor possessions, nor associates
make an iota of difference in the world. A man who is a "somebody,"
a "person to be reckoned with," is one who is a "self." He is one
whose physical possessions or personal abilities or standing in
the community make him one of the "powers that be." And it is the
desire to be a factor in the world, to increase the scope and
consequence of one's self that is the leading ingredient in what we
call ambition, and the desire for fame, and at least one ingredient
in the desire for wealth. Men may want wealth merely for the sake of
possession, or for bodily comfort, but part of the desire consists
in the ability thereby to spread one's influence, to be "one of
the happy sons of earth, who lord it over land and sea, in the
full-blown lustihood that wealth and power can give, and before
whom, stiffen ourselves as we will ... we cannot escape an emotion,
sneaking or open, of dread."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. I, p. 293.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The enhancement of the self.</b> The building-up of a more or
less permanent self is natively satisfactory to most men, and every
means will be taken to increase its scope and influence. Biologically
we are so constituted as to perform many acts making for our
self-preservation. The ordinary reflexes and instincts such as
those which prompt us to eat, to defend ourselves against blows
and the threatening approach of animals, to keep our equilibrium
and recover our balance, are examples of these.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_157"><span class="page">Page 157</span></a> The
development and preservation of our social self is also made possible
as it is initially prompted by our specifically social instincts.
There is a native tendency, as already noted, to get ourselves noticed
by other people, to seek their praise and avoid their blame. The
instincts of self-display and leadership, and many of the non-social
instincts, such as curiosity and acquisitiveness, are frequently called
into play in the service of the more directly social tendencies of
the individual. A large part of our activity, whatever be its other
motives, is determined to some degree by the desire to develop
the social self, to be a "somebody," to cut a figure in the world.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the enlargement of the social self, various people use various
means, and with varying degrees of vigor, intensity, and persistency.
There are a few who go through life with almost no sense of selfhood,
who go through their daily routine with no more recognition of their
acts as their own than that displayed by an animal or a machine. In
most men the sense of their personality and their interest in it
are high, and the development of the self is sought in all possible
or legitimate ways. The ways in which the self is developed, and
the kind of self that is sought, help to determine whether a man
is self-seeking in the lowest sense of that epithet, or idealistic
and ambitious in the approved popular sense.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The kind of self we seek to build up depends, as we have seen,
largely on the type of praise and blame and the general character
of the moral tradition to which we have been exposed. But whichever
type of self a man does select as his ideal or permanent self, all
his activities will be more or less consciously and more or less
consistently controlled by it. His habits of action, his habitual
choices, his habitual feelings, will be built up with this ideal
self as a standard and control. He will do those things which "carry
on" toward the ideal self, leave undone those things which do not.
The man or woman who wishes simply to cut a figure "socially" will
cultivate the wit, the gayety, the facility, the smartness, which
are <a name="page_158"><span class="page">Page 158</span></a> the
familiar ingredients of such a personality. The same persons will
be singularly blind to abysses of ignorance which would be painfully
in the consciousness of those who had set up for themselves ideals
of erudition and culture. A laborer will live and move and have his
being serenely in clothes and in surroundings that "would never do"
for a professional man who had committed himself to live according
to the social standards of his class. Sometimes a man's actions will
be directed toward the construction of an ideal self, on standards
far in advance of those of his group. A man in developing such
a self is, indeed, in some cases practically committing social
suicide. The extreme dissenter from the current standards of action
is attempting to build up what James has well called a "spiritual
self," a self in the light of his own ideals, rather than those
current among his contemporaries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Egoism <i>versus</i> altruism.</b> The individual in developing
his own personality need not, necessarily, be selfish, nor is the
enhancement of one's personality incompatible with altruism. One
man may find his individuality sufficiently developed in a large
bank account, another in discovering a cure for cancer; one man may
seek nothing but gratification of his physical appetites; another may
find his fulfillment on the battlefield in defense of the national
honor. Since man is born with the original tendencies to herd with
and have common sympathies with his fellows, and to pity those of
them that are weak and distressed, there is nothing more unnatural
about altruism than about egoism. It is true that in some men the
so-called altruistic impulses, the impulse to sympathize with the
emotions, feelings, aspirations and difficulties of others, and to
pity them in their distress, are comparatively weak; that in some
men the more obviously egoistic impulses, such as the gratification
of bodily desires, the acquisition of physical possessions are strong
and uncontrollable. But through education the altruistic and social
impulses of men may be cultivated and strengthened, so that they may
become more <a name="page_159"><span class="page">Page 159</span></a>
powerful and dominant than even the urgency of physical desire.
"Man cannot live by bread alone," and a man in whom a passion for
reform or for religion, for a cause or for a conquest has become
strong, will sacrifice food, sleep, and physical comfort, and may
even find the satisfactory fulfillment of self in self-sacrifice
and obliteration.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: This is partly because man's sense of selfhood is
so largely socially conditioned and affected by praise and blame.
Many a man in whom impulses of an egoistic sort are strong cannot
resist the scorn of his gang, club, or clique. In this sense even
socially beneficial actions may be "selfish."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The old distinction between egoism and altruism is thus an artificial
one. A genuinely altruistic individual derives satisfaction from the
beneficent things he does, though he does not, as Jeremy Bentham
supposed, calculate the benefits he will derive from his beneficence.
Altruism is just as natural as egoism in its origins, though the
impulses of self-preservation and personal physical satisfaction
are natively stronger and more numerous. But human beings can be
educated to altruism, and find the same satisfaction in service
to others as individuals reared in less humane conditions find
in satisfying their immediate physical desires.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Self-satisfaction and dissatisfaction.</b> Since the development
of selfhood plays so large a part in human action, it is natural that
powerful emotions should be associated with it. Individuals become
conscious of the kind of self they are and measure it favorably or
unfavorably with the kind of self they would be. In so far as the
actuality they conceive themselves to be measures up to the ideal
self, to the fulfillment of which they have dedicated themselves, they
have a feeling of self-satisfaction, of elation. They are jubilant
or crestfallen, satisfied or dissatisfied with themselves, in so
far as they are in their own estimation making good. In normal
individuals, these estimates of triumph and frustration are, of
course, colored and qualified by signs of approval and disapproval
from other people. There are very few&mdash;and these insanely
conceited&mdash;in whom the opinions of others are not largely
influential in determining their own estimates of themselves.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_160"><span class="page">Page 160</span></a> The emotions
themselves of self-satisfaction and abasement are of a unique sort
... each has its own peculiar physiognomical expression. In
self-satisfaction the extensor muscles are innervated, the eye
is strong and glorious, the gait rolling and elastic, the nostril
dilated, and a peculiar smile plays upon the lips. This complex
of symptoms is seen in an exquisite way in lunatic asylums, which
always contain some patients who are literally mad with conceit,
and whose fatuous expression and absurdly strutting or swaggering
gait is in tragic contrast with their lack of any valuable personal
quality. It is in these same castles of despair that we find the
strongest examples of the opposite physiognomy, in good people
who think they have committed "the unpardonable sin" and are lost
forever, who crouch and cringe and slink from notice, and are unable
to speak aloud or look us in the eye.... We ourselves know how
the barometer of our self-esteem and confidence rises and falls
from one day to another through causes that seem to be visceral
and organic rather than rational, and which certainly answer to
no corresponding variations in the esteem in which we are held
by our friends.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. I, p. 307.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Self-satisfaction depends, as has been said, on the kind of self
we are aiming at, and that in turn depends on the kind of self we
are. A professional bank-robber may take a craftsman's pride in
the skill with which he has rifled a safe and made off with the
booty, just as a surgeon may take pride in a delicate operation,
or a dramatist in a play. The ideal and the measure of satisfaction
will again be determined by the group among whom we move. The
bank-robber will not boast of his exploits to a missionary conference;
the surgeon will prefer to explain the details of his achievement
to medical men who can critically appreciate its technique. The
ideal self we set ourselves may far outreach our achievements,
considerable and generally applauded though these be. A man may
know in his heart how futile are his triumphs, how far from the
goals he cherished as young ideals. Many a brilliant comedian longs
to play Hamlet; the gifted and scholarly musician knows how easy
it is to win an audience with sentimental and specious music. The
humility of genius has <a name="page_161"><span class="page">Page
161</span></a> again and again been noted. "The more one knows
the less one knows one knows."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many men attain self-satisfaction through negation, through a serene
surrender of the unattainable. As the Epicureans counseled, they
increase their happiness by lessening their desires. The content
which middle-aged people exhibit is not so frequently to be traced to
the dazzling character of their achievement as to their resignation
to their station. Young people are moody and unhappy not infrequently
because they cannot make a reconciliation between what they would
be and what they are. Others again attain satisfaction vicariously
in the achievements of others, as mediocre fathers do in their
brilliant children, or as sympathetic and interested people do in
the whole world about them.
</p>

<p class="include">
The magnanimity of these expansive natures is often touching indeed.
Such persons can feel a sort of delicate rapture in thinking that,
however sick, ill-favored, mean-conditioned, and generally forsaken
they may be, they are yet integral parts of the whole of this brave
world, have a fellow's share in the strength of the dairy horses,
the happiness of the young people, the wisdom of the wise ones,
and are not altogether without part or lot in the good fortunes
of the Vanderbilts and the Hohenzollerns themselves.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. I, p. 313 (written in
1890).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In some men a modicum of success will give a disproportionate sense
of confidence and power. The man to whom success has always come
easily is not baffled by problems that would appall those who, in
middle life, "lie among the failures at the foot of the hill." As
Goethe, who had always been miraculously successful, said to one
who came to complain to him about the difficulty of an undertaking:
"You have but to blow on your hands." In a crowd one can hardly fail
to note the easy air of competence and confidence that distinguishes
the successful man of affairs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The contrast between the self and others.</b> The consciousness
of self increases with the expression of personal opinion and power.
The man whose books are translated into half a <a name="page_162"><span
class="page">Page 162</span></a> dozen languages, to whose lectures
people come from all parts of the world, cannot help feeling an
increased sense of importance, although he may combine this
consciousness with a sense of personal humility. In the same way
a man who exerts great social power, who controls the economic
lives of thousands of employees, or whose benefactions in the way
of libraries and charitable institutions dot the land, develops
inevitably a sense of his own selfhood as over against that of
the group. He begins to realize that he does make a significant
difference in the world. This was curiously illustrated in a speech
delivered by Andrew Carnegie when, after a prolonged absence in
Europe, he came back to the opening of the Carnegie Institute,
the building of which had cost him six million dollars:
</p>

<p class="include">
He said he could not bring himself to a realization of what had
been done. He felt like Aladdin when he saw this building and was
aware that he had put it up, but he could not bring himself to
consciousness of having done it any more than if he had produced
the same effect by rubbing a lamp. He could not feel the ownership
of what he had given, and he could not feel that he had given it
away.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Quoted from the obituary of Andrew Carnegie in the
<i>New York Times</i> of August 12, 1919.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
This sense of incredulity at one's actions or achievements is rarer
than the consciousness of self which it promotes. The intensity of
this self-awareness is increased when opinion is expressed or power
exerted in the face of opposition. The man who finds himself standing
out against the community in which he lives, who is a freethinker
among those who are intensely religious, an extremist among those
who are custom-ridden, spiritualistic among people who are controlled
by materialistic ideas, finds the sense of his own personality
heightened by contrast. When dissenting opinions are steadfastly
maintained in the face of the opposition of a powerful majority,
there develops a personality with edge and strength. The man who
can persist in his belief against the prevailing winds of doctrine
and of action may be wrong, but he is a <a name="page_163"><span
class="page">Page 163</span></a> personality. He is intensely and
persistently aware of himself. Similarly, the exertion of power in
the face of opposition increases the sense of one's own power and
helps to consolidate it. One derives from it the same exhilaration
that one has in feeling a canoe under the impulsion of one's paddle
overcome the resistance of the water. In the same way, the exertion
of social power in the face of obstacles makes half the exhilaration
of politics and business for some types of men in business and
political life. One admires the ruthlessness of a Napoleon at war
or of a captain of industry in the sharp industrial competition
of the nineteenth century, not because it is ruthless, but because
it is power. Such men are at least not neutral; they are positive
forces.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The contrast between the "self" and the others may be friendly, with
a recognition of all other selves as equally entitled to existence.
One pursues the even tenor of one's way, and is content to let others
pursue theirs. Men of very powerful personality have exhibited the
utmost gentleness and consideration of others. Lincoln, the typical
strong, silent man, displayed a tenderness for the suffering and
distressed that has already become proverbial.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The contrast between one's self and the world may be one of bitter
opposition, as when one's ideas or actions are subjected to social
censure. As Mill argued over half a century ago, the forceful
suppression of opinion produces a more violent manifestation of
it. Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose
like the sun in the heavens. A sense of injustice, of unfairness,
will not only intensify a man's opinions but his consciousness of
his own personality. To meet with opposition is to feel acutely
the outlines of one's own person; to be forced to recognize the
differences between ourselves and others is to discover what sort
of people we ourselves are.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The contrast is likewise one of opposition, sometimes to bitterness,
when the individual seeks to impose his own opinions or his own
personality forcibly on others. A Mohammed, fired with the zeal of a
religious enthusiasm, may <a name="page_164"><span class="page">Page
164</span></a> spread his doctrine by fire and sword and be resisted
by similar violence. Others than the Germans have betaken themselves
to arms to spread a specific and arbitrary type of life. On a small
scale it is seen wherever a fanatical parent tries to force his
own belief and type of life upon his children, reared in a younger
and freer generation. In contemporary society most individuals are
neither tempted nor permitted to coerce people to their own way of
thinking, although economic pressure and social ostracism are still
powerful instruments by which strategically situated individuals
can force their own opinions or types of life upon others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Types of self.</b> The consciousness of self varies in its expression
and intensity and at different times may display different types
or combinations of types. No one is ever utterly consistent, and
different situations, different groups, provoke different selves
in us. Nobody writes quite the same kind of letter to his different
friends, or is, as has been pointed out, the same person in different
situations. But, except for those intellectual will-o'-the-wisps, or
moral ne'er-do-wells who take on the color of every new circumstance
in which they happen to be cast, men do develop predominantly one type
of self which constitutes, in familiar language, their character.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The manner of our consciousness of our personality may vary in
quality, even though it be intense in degree. One may be aware
even of one's importance, without being "self-important." One may
be quite conscious of one's significance in the world and yet not
be "self-conscious." It is indeed usually the little man who has a
great air about him. The officiousness and pettiness of the small
soul invested with authority has often been commented on. Proverbial
wisdom has succinctly recorded the fact that empty barrels make
the most noise. Latterly, Freudian psychology has pointed out the
mechanisms by which insignificant people compensate for the poverty
of their person by bluster and brag.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: On this point see an illuminating brief discussion
by Hart in <i>The Psychology of Insanity</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_165"><span class="page">Page 165</span></a>
<b>Self-display or boldness.</b> The most obvious type of consciousness
of self is found in individuals who seek mere social conspicuousness,
who spend no inconsiderable part of their energy in deliberate
display. The child says with na&iuml;ve frankness, "See how high
I can jump." Many adults find more conspicuous or subtle ways of
saying the same thing. One need only to take a ride in a bus or
street car to find the certain symptoms of self-display. These
may consist in nothing more serious than a peculiarly conspicuous
collar or hatband, or particularly high heels. It may consist in
a loud voice full of pompous references to great banquets recently
attended or great sums recently spent. It may be in a raised eyebrow
or a disdainful smile. There are people among every one's acquaintance
whose conversation is largely made up of reminiscences of more or
less personal glory, of deliberate allusions to large salaries
and famous friends, to glorious prospects and past laurels.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Almost every college class has one or two members
who enter vociferously and continuously into discussions, less for
the contribution of ideas or information than for the propagation
of their own personalities.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On a larger scale this is to be found in the almost universal desire
to see one's name in print:
</p>

<p class="include">
There is a whole race of beings to-day whose passion is to keep
their names in the newspapers, no matter under what heading, "arrivals
and departures," "personal paragraphs," "interviews"&mdash;gossip,
even scandal will suit them if nothing better is to be had. Guiteau,
Garfield's assassin, is an example of the extremity to which this
craving for notoriety may go in a pathological case. The newspapers
bounded his mental horizon; and in the poor wretch's prayer on the
scaffold, one of the most heartfelt expressions was: "The newspaper
press of this land has a big bill to settle with thee, O Lord!"[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: James: <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. I, p. 308.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
As was pointed out in connection with praise and blame, more of
our actions than we should care to admit are determined by this
desire for recognition. The loud, the vulgar, the notoriety seekers
are merely extreme illustrations of a type of self that most of
us are some of the time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_166"><span class="page">Page 166</span></a>
<b>Self-sufficient modesty.</b> The other extreme is exhibited
by the type of personality that is markedly averse to display and
shrinks from observation. In its intensest and possibly least appealing
form it is exhibited by people who become awkwardly embarrassed
in the presence of a stranger, however fluent and vivacious they
may be with their friends. This type at its best may be described
by the epithet of self-sufficient modesty. To be such a person
may be said to be an achievement rather than a weakness. To be
self-sufficient and modest at the same time means that one is going
about one's business, that one is too absorbed in one's work to
be continually and anxiously noting what sort of figure one cuts
in the world. To quote Matthew Arnold's well-known lines:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,<br />
&nbsp; Undistracted by the sights they see,<br />
&nbsp; These demand not that the things without them<br />
&nbsp; Yield them love, amusement, sympathy."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: <i>Self-Dependence.</i>]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are in every great university quiet great men who steadily
pursue vital and difficult researches without the slightest reference
or desire for cheap conspicuousness. In every profession and business
there are known to the discriminating men who are experts, even
geniuses in their own field, but who shrink back from the loudness
of publicity as from a plague. There are a number of wealthy
philanthropists in all our large cities who consistently and steadily
do good works in almost complete anonymity. One finds in almost
every department of human activity these types of self-effacing
men who find their fulfillment in the work they do rather than
in moving in the aura of other people's admiration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The positive and flexible self.</b> But in order to be effective
in affairs, some positive force must be displayed, and modesty
need not mean pusillanimity. A frequently observable type of
personality&mdash;and socially one of a highly desirable sort&mdash;is
the type of man who, himself standing for positive convictions, ideas,
and principles of action, and not casually <a name="page_167"><span
class="page">Page 167</span></a> to be deflected from them, has
sufficient flexibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others,
to accept modification. Such a self not only has its initial force
and momentum, but gains as it goes by the experience of others.
A personality must be positive to contribute to the solution of
difficulties and the management of enterprises, but it must be receptive
in order to benefit by the ideas of others and co&ouml;perate with
them. To have power and humility at once is sometimes sufficient to
make a leader among men. Humility prevents us from rushing headlong
along the paths of our own dogmatic errors; it enables us further
to deal with other people who would be simply antagonized by our
flat-footed insistence on every detail of our own initial position.
The history of great statesmanship is in part, at least, the history
of wise compromise. Nor does this mean sordid temporizing and
opportunism. As John Morley puts it:
</p>

<p class="include">
It is the worst of political blunders to insist on carrying an
ideal set of principles into execution, where others have rights of
dissent, and those others persons whose assent is as indispensable
to success as it is difficult to attain. But to be afraid or ashamed
of holding such an ideal set of principles in one's mind in their
highest and most abstract expression, does more than any other one
cause to stunt or petrify those elements of character to which
life should owe most of its savor.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Morley: <i>On Compromise</i>, p. 123.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Dogmatism and self-assertion.</b> Too often, however, a person
of powerful and distinctive opinions is so moved by the momentum of
his own strong enthusiasms, so fixed by the habitual definiteness
of his own position that he cannot be swayed. In its worst form
this is rampant egoism and dogmatism. All of us have met the
loud-mouthed exponent of his own opinions, who speaks whatever
be the subject, as if <i>his</i> position only were plausible or
possible, and as if all who gain-said him were either fools or
knaves.
</p>

<p class="include">
If we examine the mental furniture of the average man we shall
find it made up of a vast number of judgments of a very precise
kind <a name="page_168"><span class="page">Page 168</span></a>
upon subjects of very great variety, complexity, and difficulty.
He will have fairly settled views upon the origin and nature of
the universe, and upon what he will probably call its meaning;
he will have conclusions as to what is to happen to him at death
and after, as to what is and what should be the basis of conduct.
He will know how the country should be governed, and why it is
going to the dogs, why this piece of legislation is good and that
bad. He will have strong views upon military and naval strategy,
the principles of taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination,
the treatment of influenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon
municipal trading, the teaching of Greek, upon what is permissible
in art, satisfactory in literature, and hopeful in science.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational
basis, since many of them are concerned with problems admitted by
the expert to be still unsolved, while as to the rest it is clear
that the training and experience of no average man can qualify
him to have any opinion on them at all.[1]

[Footnote 1: Trotter: <i>Instincts of the Herd</i>, p. 36.]

<p class="indent">
In action as well as opinion dogmatism and unbridled self-assertion
may be the dominant characteristics of a personality. The man who
has a strong will and little social sympathy will be ruthlessly
insistent on the attainment of his own ends. This type of self has
indeed been set up as an ideal by such philosophers as Nietzsche
and Max Stirner, who urged that the really great man should express
his own personality irrespective of the weaklings whom he might
crush in his comet-like career. Thus writes Nietzsche in one of
his characteristic passages:
</p>

<p class="include">
The <i>Superman</i> I have at heart; <i>that</i> is the first and

the poorest, not the sorriest, not the best....

In that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me hope....
In that ye have despaired, there is much to honor. For ye have not

For to-day have the petty people become master; they all preach
submission, and humility, and policy, and diligence, and consideration,
and the long <i>et cetera</i> of petty virtues.

<a name="page_169"><span class="page">Page 169</span></a> It need
scarcely be noted that even if the genius or Superman were justified,
as this philosophy insists, on ruthlessly asserting his priority,
it is a dangerous procedure to identify one's ambitions with one's
desserts. As already noted, a flamboyant assurance of one's own
importance is sometimes a ludicrous symptom of the reverse.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The more legitimate manifestation of strong individualism in action
or opinion is in the case of deeply conscientious natures, who
will not compromise by a hair's breadth from what they conceive
to be the right. The fanatic is seldom an appealing character,
but he is a type that enforces admiration. Of such unflinching
insistence are martyrs and great leaders made. There are in every
community men who will regard it as treachery to their highest
ideals to compromise at all from the inviolable principles to which
they feel themselves committed. Such men are difficult to deal with
in human situations involving co&ouml;peration and compromise,
and they exhibit frequently a rigid austerity, bitterness, and
hate that do not readily win sympathy. But it is to such men as
these that many religious and social reforms owe their initiation.
Bertrand Russell, who, whether one agrees with him or not, exhibits
a puritanical devotion to his social beliefs, has finely described
the type:
</p>

<p class="include">
The impatient idealist&mdash;and without some impatience a man
will hardly prove effective&mdash;is almost sure to be led into
hatred by the oppositions and disappointments which he encounters
in his endeavors to bring happiness to the world. The more certain
he is of the purity of his motives and the truth of his gospel, the
more indignant will he become when his teaching is rejected....
The intense faith which enables him to withstand persecution for the
sake of his beliefs makes him consider these beliefs so luminously
obvious that any thinking man who rejects them must be dishonest
and must be actuated by some sinister motive of treachery to the
cause.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Russell: <i>Proposed Roads to Freedom</i>, pp. xiii-xiv.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Enthusiasm.</b> The enthusiast is another type of self that
plays an important part in social life and makes not the least <a
name="page_170"><span class="page">Page 170</span></a> attractive
of its figures. The exuberant exponent of ideas, causes, persons, or
institutions is an effective preacher, teacher, or leader of men,
and may be, apart from his utility, intrinsically of the utmost charm.
Emotions vividly displayed are, as already pointed out in connection
with sympathy, readily duplicated in others, and the ardors of
the enthusiast are, when they have the earmarks of sincerity,
contagious. A genuinely enthusiastic personality kindles his own
fire in the hearts of others, and makes them appreciate as no mere
formal analysis could, the vital and moving aspects of things.
Good teaching has been defined as communication by contagion, and
the teachers whom students usually testify to have influenced them
most are not those who doled out flat prescribed wisdom, but those
whose own informed ardor for their subject-matter communicated to
the student a warm sense of its significance. Leaders of great
movements who have been successful in controlling the energies and
loyalties of millions of men have been frequently men of this high
and contagious voltage. It certainly constituted part of Theodore
Roosevelt's political strength, and, in more or less genuine form,
is the asset of every successful political speaker and leader.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both for the one controlled by enthusiasm and for the others to
whom it spreads, experience becomes richer in significance. Poets
and the poetically-minded have to a singular degree the power of
clothing with imaginative enthusiasm all the items of their experience.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Enthusiasm does not necessarily connote hysteria or sentimentalism.
The unstable enthusiast is a familiar type, the man who has another
object of eagerness and loyalty each week. Mark Twain describes
the type in the person of his brother, who had a dozen different
ambitions a year. But enthusiasm may be a long-sustained devotion
to a single ideal. A curious instance of it was seen in the case
of an Armenian scholar who, so it is reported to the writer by a
student of Armenian culture, spent forty years in mastering cuneiform
<a name="page_171"><span class="page">Page 171</span></a> script in
order to prove that the Phrygians were descended from the Armenians,
and not <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Shelley could kindle the spirit of revolution in thousands who
would have been bored to death with the same fiery doctrines in the
abstract and cold pages of Godwin, from whom Shelley derived his
ideas of "political justice." The enthusiast, since he instinctively
likes to share his emotions, not infrequently displays an intense
desire for leadership, not so much that he may be a leader as that
he may win converts to his own cause or creed. Such a personality
finds its satisfaction in some form of proselyting zeal, be it
for a religion, for a favorite charity, for good books, poetry,
or social justice. A well-known literary scholar who died recently
was thus described by one of his former students:
</p>

<p class="include">
Dr. Gummere was not a teacher; he was a vital atmosphere and his
lectures, as one considered them from an intellectual or emotional
angle, were revelations or adventures. There never were such classes
as his, we believed. Who could equal him in readiness of wit? Where
was there such a raconteur? Who else could put the feel of a poem
into one's heart? ... His voice was very deep, and exceedingly
free and flexible. It always seemed to brim up as from a spirit
overflowing. Everything about him was individual and spontaneous. He
was perhaps most like a powerful river that braced one's energies,
and carried one along without the slightest desire to resist.[1]

</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The negative self.</b> All the types of personality or self that
have thus far been discussed are in some way positive or assertive.
But the self may be exhibited negatively, in a shrinking, not only
from observation, but from any positive or pronounced action. This
has already been noted in connection with submissiveness. Most
people in the presence of their intellectual and social or even
their physical superior, experience a sense of, to use McDougall's
term, "negative self-feeling." In some people this negation or
effacement of the self is a predominant characteristic.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It may be mere social timidity, which, in the case of those <a
name="page_172"><span class="page">Page 172</span></a> continually
placed in servile positions, as in the case of the proverbial "poor
relation," may become chronic. In its most disagreeable form it is
exhibited as an obsequious flattering and a pretentious humility. Of
this the classic instance is Uriah Heep in <i>David Copperfield</i>:
</p>

<p class="include">
"I suppose you are quite a great lawyer," I [David Copperfield]
said, after looking at him for some time.
</p>

<p class="include">
"Me, Master Copperfield?" said Uriah. "Oh, no! I'm a very umble
person."
</p>

<p class="include">
It was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he frequently
ground the palms against each other, as if to squeeze them dry
and warm, besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his
pocket-handkerchief.
</p>

<p class="include">
"I am well aware that I am the umblest person going," said Uriah
Heep modestly, "let the other be where he may. My mother is likewise
a very umble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield,
but have much to be thankful for. My father's former calling was
umble. He was a sexton."
</p>

<p class="include">
"What is he now?" I asked.
</p>

<p class="include">
"He is a partaker of glory, at present, Master Copperfield, but
we have much to be thankful for. How much have I to be thankful
for, in living with Mr. Wickfield."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Negative self-feeling may be provoked by a genuine sense of unworthiness
or modesty, and when this takes place among religious people, it
may become a complete and rapturous submissiveness to God. The
records of many medi&aelig;val and of some modern mystics emphasize
this complete yielding to the will of God, and in His will finding
peace. James quotes in this connection Pascal's <i>Pri&egrave;re
pour bien user les maladies</i>:
</p>

<p class="include">
I ask you, neither for health nor for sickness, for life nor for
death; but that you may dispose of my health and my sickness, my life
and my death, for your glory.... You alone know what is expedient
for me; you are the sovereign master; do with me according to your
will. Give to me, or take away from me, only conform my will to
yours. I know but one thing, Lord, that it is good to follow you,
and bad to offend you. Apart from that, I know not what is good
or bad in anything. I know not which is most profitable to me,
health or sickness, wealth or poverty, nor anything else in the
world. That discernment is beyond the power of men or angels, and
is hidden <a name="page_173"><span class="page">Page 173</span></a>
among the secrets of your Providence, which I adore, but do not
seek to fathom.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Quoted in James: <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>,
p. 286.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Self-surrender, however, takes other forms than religious absorption
or devotion. "Saintliness" is not unknown in secular forms of life,
in the devotion of men to any ideal, despite pain and privation of
worldly goods and successes. The doctor sacrificing his life in
a leper colony is an extreme example. But something of the same
humility and submissiveness is exhibited every time a man makes
a choice which places the welfare of other people before his own
immediate success. It is shown by the thousands of physicians and
settlement workers and teachers who spend their lives in patient
devotion to labors that bring little remuneration and as little
glory. Men of affairs and a large proportion of other men generally
measure worth by worldly success. But even from the worldly, such
signs of self-surrender elicit admiration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Eccentrics.</b> There is one type of self so various and
miscellaneous that it can only be subsumed under the general epithet,
"eccentric." These are the unexpectedly large number of individuals in
our civilization who do not come under any of the usual categories,
who display some small or great abnormality which sets them off from
the general run of men. That some of these are accounted eccentric
is to be explained in the light of man's tendency, as a gregarious
animal, to think "queer" and "freakish" anything off the beaten track.
Some are clearly and unmistakably abnormal in some physiological
or psychological respect. From these are recruited the inmates
of our penitentiaries and insane asylums and the candidates for
them. But there are eccentricities of social behavior, types of
personality which though they cannot be classed as either insane
or criminal, yet definitely set an individual apart.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These include what Trotter has called the "mentally unstable," as
set over against "the great class of normal, sensible, reliable middle
age, with its definite views, its resiliency <a name="page_174"><span
class="page">Page 174</span></a> to the depressing influence of
facts, and its gift for forming the backbone of the State." There
are the large group of slightly neurasthenic, made so, in part,
by the high nervous tension under which modern, especially modern
urban, life is lived. These include what are commonly called the
hysterical or over-emotional, or "temperamental" types. In a
civilization where most professions demand regularity, restraint,
punctuality, and directness, unstability and excess emotionalism
are necessarily at a discount. There are the vagabond types who,
like young Georges, Jean-qhristophe's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, regard
a profession as a prison house, in which most of one's capacities
are cruelly confined. There are again those who, possessing singular
and exclusive sensitivity to &aelig;sthetic values, to music, art,
and poetry, find the world outside their own lyric enthusiasms
flat, stale, and unprofitable. If, as so frequently happens, these
combine, along with their peculiar temperaments, little genius
and slender means, social and economic life becomes for them a
blind alley. Every year at our great universities we see small
groups of young men, who, having spent three or four years on
philosophy, literature, and the liberal arts, and having no interest
in academic life, are put to it to find a profession in which they
can find a genuine interest or possible success.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Among these "eccentrics" a few have been reckoned geniuses by their
contemporaries or by posterity. In such cases society hesitates
to apply its usual formul&aelig;. One cannot condemn out of hand
a Shelley. He is not of the run of men.
</p>

<p class="include">
Shelley was one of those spokesmen of the <i>a priori</i>, one of
those nurslings of the womb, like a bee or a butterfly, a dogmatic,
inspired, perfect, and incorrigible creature.... Being a finished
child of nature, not a joint product, like most of us, of nature,
history, and society, he abounded miraculously in his own clear
sense, but was obtuse to the droll miscellaneous lessons of fortune.
The cannonade of hard inexplicable facts that knocks into most of us
what little wisdom we have, left Shelley dazed and sore, perhaps,
but uninstructed.[1]
</p>

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_175"><span class="page">Page 175</span></a> It is
difficult to draw the line in some cases between genius and insanity.[1]
There have been time and again in society Cassandras who have spoken
true prophecies and have been thought mad. There have been, on the
other hand, those who, having some of the external eccentricities
of genius, have given an illusive impression of greatness. The
professional Bohemian likes to make himself great by wearing his
hair long and living in a garret. But it is unquestionably true
that a highly sensitive and creative mind is often ill at ease
in the world of action, and remains a vagabond, an <i>enfant
terrible</i> or an eccentric all through life. It remains a fact
that in contemporary society there are a small number of people,
some of them of considerable talents, who simply cannot be made
to fit into the social routine. For such Bertrand Russell suggests
a "vagabond's wage." This he conceives as being just large enough
to enable them to get along, to give them a chance to wander and
experiment, but sufficiently small to penalize them for not settling
down to the accustomed social routines.[2]

pronounced to be really extraordinary lyrics. He was at the same

casual habits and absorption would have prevented him from getting

<p class="indent">
Mill has generalized the situation of the genius:
</p>

<p class="include">
Persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be,
a small minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to
preserve the soil in which they grow. Genius can only breathe freely
in an <i>atmosphere</i> of freedom. Persons of genius are, <i>ex
vi termini</i>, more individual than any other people&mdash;less
capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful
compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society
provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their
own character.... If they are of a <a name="page_176"><span
class="page">Page 176</span></a> strong character, and break their
fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded
in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning
as "wild," "erratic," and the like; much as if one should complain
of the Niagara River for not flowing smoothly between its banks,
like a Dutch canal.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Essay on Liberty</i>, chap. III.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The active and the contemplative.</b> One final distinction
must be made, one that cuts across all the types of self hitherto
discussed, namely, the distinction between the man of action and
the man of thought. One need not go far in literature or in life to
find the contrast made. In the Scriptures Mary is set over against
Martha, Rachel against Leah. Hamlet and Ulysses are permanent
representations of the melancholy thinker and the exuberant adventurer.
The business man and the executive may be put over against the
poet and the scholar; the strenuous organizer and administrator
over against the quiet philosopher. Both have their outstanding
uses, and, in their extreme forms, their outstanding defects. The
active type, as we say, "gets things done." He builds bridges and
industries; he manages markets and men. His eye is on the practical;
he is dependable, rapid, and efficient. In an industrial civilization
he is the great heroic type. The statesman and the railroad builder,
the newspaper editors and the political leaders captivate the
imaginations as they control the destinies of mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the other hand, there are those who stand aside (either from
incapacity or disinclination or both) from the management of affairs
and the life of action, and spend their lives in observation and
contemplation. Plato and Aristotle regarded this as the highest
type of life; it may have been because they were themselves both
philosophers. In its extreme form it is exhibited in such men as
Spinoza or Kant, spending their lives in practical obscurity,
speculating on time and space and eternity. But it is apparent in
less extreme types. The "patient observer," the genial spectator
of other men's actions is not infrequent. When he has literary gifts
he is a philosopher <a name="page_177"><span class="page">Page
177</span></a> or a poet. Lucretius in a famous passage stated
the contemplative ideal, contrasting it with its opposite:
</p>

<p class="include">
Sweet it is when on the great seas the winds are buffeting, to
gaze from the land on another's great struggles; not because it
is pleasure or joy that any one should be distressed, but because
it is sweet to perceive from what misfortunes you yourself are
free. Sweet is it, too, to behold great contests of war in full
array over the plains, when you have no part in the danger. But
nothing is more gladdening than to dwell in the calm high places,
firmly embattled on the heights by the teaching of the wise, whence
you can look down on others, and see them wandering hither and
thither and going astray, as they seek the way of life, in strife
matching their wits or rival claims of birth, struggling night and
day by surpassing effort to rise up to the height of power and
gain possession of the world.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Lucretius: <i>De Rerum Natura</i> (Bailey translation),
book II, lines 1-12.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But in the two types it is not the fruit of action or contemplation,
but action and contemplation themselves that the two types find
respectively interesting. The man of action finds an immediate
satisfaction in movement, change, the clamor of affairs, the contacts
with other people, the making of changes in the practical world.
The man of thought finds as immediate enjoyment in noting the ways
of men, and reflecting upon them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That contemplation, disinterested thinking, also has its use goes
without saying. The thinker and the dreamer may be something at
least of what the Irish poet boasts:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"... the movers and shakers<br />
&nbsp; Of the world, forever, it seems."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The scholar, the thinker, the man who stands aside from immediate
action, may, often does, help the world of action in a far-reaching
way. The researches of a Newton make possible eventually the feats
of modern engineering and telegraphy; the abstruse study of the
calculus helps to build bridges and skyscrapers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both types, in their extremes, have their weaknesses. The extremely
practical man "may cut off the limb upon which he is sitting," or
"see no further than the end of his nose." A <a name="page_178"><span
class="page">Page 178</span></a> really great administrator is not
penny-wise; he thinks far ahead, around and into a problem. He is
concerned for tomorrow as well as to-day. The contemplative man may
come to be "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought." There is
the hero of one Russian novel who reflects through three hundred
pages on his wasted life, all at the ripe age of twenty-three.[1]
The practical man gains width and insight by checking himself with
reflection; the contemplative finds thought called home and made
meaningful by contacts with the world. It was something of this
balance which Plato had in mind when he insisted that his future
philosopher-king should, after fifteen years' study, go for fifteen
years into the "cave" or world to learn to deal with men and affairs.
The "mere theorist" is often an absurd if not a dangerous character;
the practical man may come to make the wheels go round without
ever taking note of his direction.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Contchareff: <i>Oblomoff</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
As pointed out in the beginning of this discussion, no one of these
types is exclusively exemplified in any one individual. To be
exclusively any one of these would be to be a caricature rather
than a character.[2] But to be no one of these types to any degree
at all is to be no character at all, is to be socially a nonentity,
a minus quantity; it is to be determined by the vicissitudes of
chance or circumstance; it is to be a succession of vacillations
rather than a distinctive self-determined personality. Each of
these types, moreover, if not extreme, has its specific excellences,
and their various presence lends richness and diversity to social
life.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Dickens's success lay, perhaps chiefly, in his ability
to draw these unforgettable exaggerations, these outstanding types:
"Micawber" waiting for something to turn up; the fiendish cruelty
of "Bill Sikes"; the angelic self-effacement of "Little Nell"; the
hypocritical "Mr. Pecksniff"; the gossipy "Sairy Gamp." He had
a unique gift for representing psychological traits in large. The
so-called psychological novelists like Meredith, trace a character
through its moods and fluctuations, making truer, more composite,
though less memorable characters.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Emotions aroused in the maintenance of the self.</b> These various
types of self may be defended with bitterness and <a
name="page_179"><span class="page">Page 179</span></a> pertinacity,
and in their support the most powerful emotions may be enlisted.
As pointed out in connection with individuality in opinion, men
may be willing to die for their beliefs. Similarly invasion of
one's home, infringement or threat against what one regards as
one's rights or one's possessions, whether physical or social,
may be bitterly contested. And in this conflict in support of the
integrity of the self, anger, hate, fear, submissiveness, all the
nuances of emotion may be aroused. The themes of great tragedy are
built largely on this theme of insistent selfhood. Any obstruction
of the self-integrity one has set one's self may provoke a violent
reaction. It may be interference with one's love, as in the case of
Medea or Othello, the pain of ingratitude as in Lear, the conflict
between "the lower and the higher self," as in the case of Macbeth's
loyalty and his ambition. These are the staple materials of drama.
In common experience, an insult to one's wife or friend, an obstacle
placed in the way of one's professional career, deprivation of
one's liberty or one's property, or one's unhindered "pursuit of
happiness," are the provocations to violent emotions in the sustaining
of the self. How violent or what form the reaction will take depends
on the situation of the "self" involved. If one has been grossly
insulted by another upon whom one is utterly dependent socially
and economically, a rankling and impotent rage may be the only
outlet. To a person gifted with humility, the disillusions of a
false friendship may provoke nothing more than a deep but resigned
disappointment. Where passion and determination run high, and
retaliation is feasible, a violent hate may find violent fulfillment.
In earlier and more bloodthirsty days, the dagger, the duel, and
poison were, as illustrated in the history of the Borgias, ways
of maintaining the self and venting one's anger or revenge. Even
in modern society the still distressingly large number of crimes
of violence may be traced in many, perhaps most cases, to blind and
bitter hate. To any deep personal injury, hate, whether it takes
overt form or not, is still the instinctive <a name="page_180"><span
class="page">Page 180</span></a> answer; just such hate as Euripides
represents in the jealous Medea, when she, a barbarian captive
among the Greeks, sees Jason, her lover, about to be married to
a Greek princess:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"... But I, being citiless, am cast aside,<br />
&nbsp;By him that wedded me, a savage bride.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />
&nbsp;Some path, if even now my hand can win,<br />
&nbsp;Strength to requite this Jason for his sin,<br />
&nbsp;Betray me not! Oh, in all things but this,<br />
&nbsp;I know how full of fears a woman is,<br />
&nbsp;And faints at need, and shrinking from the light<br />
&nbsp;Of battle; but once spoil her of her right<br />
&nbsp;In man's love, and there moves, I warn thee well,<br />
&nbsp;No bloodier spirit between Heaven and Hell."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Euripides: <i>Medea</i> (Gilbert Murray translation),

</p>

<p class="indent">
In defense of the self in its narrower or broader sense, courage
and heroism may be displayed. The martyr will die rather than submit;
there have been many to whom Patrick Henry's "Give me Liberty or
give me death," was something more than rhetoric. The self for
which we will fight, of course, varies. A spoilt child will go
into a paroxysm of rage if its toy is taken away. Older people
will fight for smaller or larger points of social position. There
is the familiar citizen who will insist on his rights, often of
a petty sort, in a hotel, theater, or department store. Or a man
may display the last extremity of courage in defense of some ideal,
as in a man's surrender of his life for his country. Something of
the same heroism is displayed by individuals who stand out against
their group in the face of ridicule or persecution. It is the general
sympathy with the desire to preserve one's selfhood untarnished
that gives point to Henley's lines:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Out of the night that covers me,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
&nbsp; I thank whatever gods may be<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my unconquerable soul.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />
"It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
&nbsp; I am the master of my fate,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am the captain of my soul."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Invictus</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_181"><span class="page">Page 181</span></a> In the
same way as the emotions fear, anger, and hate, and their variations
and degrees, may be aroused by attack or threat against the self,
so help and encouragement of an individual's selfhood arouse love,
affection, and gratitude. Even our affection for our parents, though
in part instinctive, is undoubtedly increased by the care and
persistence with which they have fostered our own life and hopes,
have educated us, and made possible for us a career. The same motives
play a part in our affection for teachers who have beneficently

in religious ritual been colored with gratitude for God's mercies
and benevolences.

<b>The individuality of groups.</b> Groups may display the same
individuality and sense of selfhood as is exhibited by individuals.
And the members of the group may come to regard the group life
as something quite as important and inalienable as their own
personalities and possessions. Indeed in defense of the integrity
of the group life, as in the case, for example, of national honor,
the individual life and possession may come to be reckoned as naught.
Man's gregariousness and his instinctive sympathy with his own
kind make it easy for the individual to identify his own life with
that of the group. What threatens or endangers the group will in
consequence arouse in him the same emotions as are aroused by threats
or dangers that concern his own personality. An insult to the flag
may send a thrill of danger through the millions who read about
it, just as would an insult to themselves or their families.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Group feeling may exist on various levels. It may be nothing more
momentous than local pride, having the tallest tower, the finest
amusement park, the best baseball team, or being the "sixth largest
city." It may be a belligerent imperialism, a "desire for a place in
the sun." It may be a desire for independence and an autonomous group
life, manifested so strikingly recently by such small nationalities
as <a name="page_182"><span class="page">Page 182</span></a> Poland
and Czecho-Slovakia and influential in keeping Switzerland alive
as a nationality through hundreds of years, though surrounded by
powerful neighbors.[1] While a group does not exist save as an
abstraction, looked at as a whole it may exhibit the same outstanding
traits, or the same types of selfhood as an individual. It may be
fiercely belligerent and dogmatic; it may, like literary exponents
of the German ideal, desire to spread its own conception of Kultur
throughout the world.[2] It may be insistent on its own position,
or its own possessions or its own glory. It may be fanatic in
aggrandizement. It may be interested in the welfare of other groups,
as in the case of large nationalities championing and protecting the
causes of small or oppressed ones, such an ideal as was expressed,
for example, by President Wilson in his address to Congress on the
entrance of America into the Great War:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Group feeling may be displayed under the most
disadvantageous conditions, as in the strong sentiment for nationalism
current among the Jews, even through all the centuries of dispersion.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Thorstein Veblen has pointed out how the "common man"
comes to identify his interest with that of the group: "The common
man who so lends himself to the aggressive enhancement of the national
Culture and its prestige has nothing of a material kind to gain from
the increase of renown that comes to his sovereign, his language,
his countrymen's art or science, his dietary, or his God. There
are no sordid motives in all this. These spiritual assets of
self-complacency are indeed to be rated as grounds of high-minded
patriotism without afterthought." (<i>The Nature of Peace</i>,
p. 56.)]

<p class="include">
... We shall fight for the things which we have always carried

The selfhood displayed by various groups varies with the degree
and integration of the individual within the group. In extreme
cases, such as that of Germany under the imperial r&eacute;gime,
the group individuality may completely overshadow and engulf that
of the individual. This ideal was not infrequently expressed by
German political writers:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_183"><span class="page">Page 183</span></a> To us
the state is the most indispensable as well as highest requisite
of our earthly existence.... All individualistic endeavor must
be unreservedly subordinated to this lofty claim.... The state
eventually is of infinitely more value than the sum of the individuals
within its jurisdiction. This conception of the state which is
as much a part of our life as the blood in our veins, is nowhere
to be found in the English constitution, and is quite foreign to
English thought, and to that of America as well.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

and Development and the War Against Germany</i> (English translation),

</p>

<p class="indent">
While custom-bound and feudal r&eacute;gimes may emphasize the
tendency to suppress development of individuality, and insist on
regimentation in thought and action&mdash;an ideal proclaimed with
increasing generality in Germany from Hegel down[2] there may be
on the part of both individuals and groups the tendency to promote
individuality as itself a social good. In such a case the social
structure and educational systems and methods will be designed
to promote individuality rather than to suppress it. Individual
variations, if it be generally recognized that they are the only
source of progress, will be utilized and cultivated instead of
suppressed.[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: See Dewey: <i>German Philosophy and Politics</i>.]

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: Individuality is the theme of Montessori kindergarten
methods.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Throughout the nineteenth century (indeed throughout the history
of political theory), the pendulum swung between individualism and
complete socialization. Spencer long ago proclaimed the dominance
of the individual; T. H. Green, following the German philosophers,
the dominance of the state. Like the contrast between egoism and
altruism, an emphasis on either side is bound to be artificial.
The individual can only be a self in a social order; the individual
is only an individual in contrast with others. It is doubtful,
for example, whether a man living all his life alone on a desert
island would discover any individuality at all. A man's character is
displayed in action, and his actions are always, or nearly always,
performed with reference to other people. And a man's best
self-realization cannot be achieved save in <a name="page_184"><span
class="page">Page 184</span></a> congenial social order. A man
will not readily grow into a saint among a society of sinners,
and unless the social order provides opportunities for the highest
type of life, it will exist only in a very fortunate and favored
few. One of the charges that has been laid against democracy is
that it fails to encourage the highest types of scientific and
artistic interests, that it is the gospel of the mediocre.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: This is the essence of the aristocratic position, that
a choice life lived by a few is better than a vulgar one shared
by the many.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is too often forgotten, on the other hand, by those who emphasize
the importance of society, that society is, after all, nothing
more than an aggregate of selves. The "state," the "social order"
is nothing but the individuals who make it up, and their relations
to each other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The group exists, after all, even as the most completely socialized
political doctrines insist, for the realization of individual selves,
for freedom of opportunity and initiative. It is when "individualism"
runs rampant, when self-realization on the part of one individual
interferes with self-realization on the part of all others that
individualism becomes a menace. Individuality is itself valuable,
in the first place, because as Mill pointed out in his essay on
<i>Liberty</i> earlier quoted:
</p>

<p class="include">
What has made the European family an improving instead of a stationary
portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them, which,
when it exists, exists as the effect, not the cause; but their
remarkable diversity of character and culture. Individuals, classes,
nations, have been extremely unlike one another; they have struck
out a great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable;
and although at every period those who traveled in different paths
have been intolerant of one another, and each would have thought
it an excellent thing if all the rest could have been compelled to
travel his road, their attempts to thwart each other's development
have rarely had any permanent success, and each has endured in
time to receive the good which the others have offered.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Mill: <i>Essay on Liberty</i>, chap. III.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Apart from the variations in group customs and traditions, and
their progressive application to changing circumstances <a
name="page_185"><span class="page">Page 185</span></a> which
individuality makes possible, it cannot be too strongly emphasized
that society is the name for the process by which individuals live
together. It is the individuals who are the realities and the happiness
of individuals which is the aim of social organization. Such happiness
is only attainable when individuals are allowed to make the most
of their native capacities and individual interests. The social
group as a group will be more interesting, colorful, and various
when every experimentation and variety of life are encouraged and
promoted. And the individuals in such a society will be personalities,
not the mere mechanisms of a regimented routine.

CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="subtitle">INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The meaning of individual differences.</b> The major part of
this volume has been devoted to a consideration of those traits,
interests, and capacities which all individuals share, and which
may in general be described as the "original nature of man." These
distinctive inborn tendencies were treated, for purposes of analysis,
in the most general terms, and, on the whole, as if they appeared
in the same strength and variety in all individuals. When we thus
stand off and abstract those characteristics which appear universally
in all individuals, human nature appears constant. But there are
marked variations in the specific content of human nature with
which each individual is at birth endowed. Put in another way, one
might say that to be a human being means to be by nature pugnacious,
curious, subject to fatigue, responsive to praise and blame, etc.,
and susceptible to training in all these respects. By virtue of
the fact that we are all members of the human race, we have common
characteristics; by virtue that we are <i>individuals</i>, we all
display specific variations in specific human capacities. There
is, save abstractly, no such thing as a standard human being. We
may intellectually set up a norm or standard, but it will be a
norm or standard from which every individual is bound to vary.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fact that individuals do differ, and in specific and definable
respects, has most serious consequences for social life. It means,
briefly, that while general inferences may be drawn from wide and
accurate observations of the workings of human nature, these inferences
remain general and tentative, and if taken as rigid rules are sure
to be misleading. Theories of education and social reform certainly
gain from the general laws that can be formulated about original human
traits, <a name="page_187"><span class="page">Page 187</span></a>
fatigue, memory, learning capacity, and the like. But they must,
if they are to be applicable, take account also, in a precise and
systematic way, of the variety of men's interests and capacities. To
this fact of variety in the original nature of different men social
institutions and educational methods must be adapted. Arbitrary
rules that apply to human nature in general do not apply to the
specific cases and specific types of talent and desires. Educational
and social organizations can mould these, but the result of these
environmental influences will vary with individual differences in
original capacities. We can waste an enormous amount of time and
energy trying to train a person without mechanical or mathematical
gifts to be an engineer. We not only save energy and time, but
promote happiness, if we can train individuals so that their specific
gifts will be capitalized at one hundred per cent. They will be
at once more useful to society and more content with themselves,
when they are using to the full their own capacities. They will
at once be unproductive and unhappy when they find themselves in
activities or social situations where their genuine talents are given
no opportunity and where their defects put them at a conspicuous
handicap.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Individuals differ, it must further be noted, not only in specific
traits, but in that complex of traits which is commonly called
"intelligence." In the broadest terms, we mean by an individual's
intelligence his competence and facility in dealing with his
environment, physical, social, and intellectual. This competence
and facility, in so far as it is a native endowment, consists of
a number of traits present in a more or less high degree, traits,
for example, such as curiosity, flexibility of native and acquired
reactions, sociability, sympathy, and the like. In a sense an individual
possesses not a single intelligence, but many, as many as there
are types of activity in which he engages. But one may classify
intelligence under three heads, as does Thorndike:[1] mechanical
intelligence, involved in dealing with things; social intelligence,
involved in <a name="page_188"><span class="page">Page 188</span></a>
dealing with other persons; and abstract intelligence, involved
in dealing with the relations between ideas. Each of these types
of intelligence involves the presence in a high degree of a group
of different traits. Thus, in social intelligence, a high degree
of sympathy, sensitivity to praise and blame, leadership, and the
like, are more requisite than they are for intelligent behavior
in the realm of mechanical operations or of mathematical theory.
A person may be highly intelligent in one of these three spheres
and mentally helpless in the others. Thus, a brilliant philosopher
may be nonplused by a stalled motor; a successful executive may
be a babe in the realm of abstract ideas. But what we rate as a
person's general intelligence is a kind of average struck between
his various competences, an estimate of his general ability to
control himself in the miscellaneous variety of situations of which
his experience consists.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "Measuring Intelligence," <i>Harper's Magazine</i>,
March, 1920.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There have been a number of tests devised for the purpose of estimating
an individual's general intelligence.[1] On a rating scale such as
is used in these examinations most individuals will come up to a
certain standard that may be called average or normal. There will
be a certain number so far below the normal rating in a complex
of traits that go to produce intelligent (competent and facile)
behavior that they will have to be classed as subnormal, ranging
from feeblemindedness to idiocy. A certain number will be found
so extraordinarily gifted in general traits and in specific
abilities&mdash;in given subject-matters, as, for example, in
mathematics and music&mdash;that they will be marked out as geniuses.
Following the laws of probability, the greater the inferiority or
superiority, the more exceptional it will be.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: These, in large part, deal with words and ideas and
are, therefore, weighted in favor of abstract intelligence, and put
at a discount individuals whose experience and whose intelligence are
predominantly social or mechanical in character. Some of the tests
are fairly adequate for mechanical intelligence, but no good tests
have been devised for social intelligence. These tests, however, as
used in the army and for appraising college entrants, as at Columbia
University, have been demonstrated to be fairly good indices of
general intelligence.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_189"><span class="page">Page 189</span></a> Individual
differences are, therefore, seen to be not simply differences with
respect to given mental traits, but differences with respect to
general mental capacity. Experimental investigation points to a
graded difference in mental capacity, ranging from idiocy to genius,
the largest group being normal or average, the size of the group
diminishing with further deviation from the average in either direction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Certain important correlations, furthermore, have been found between
the level of intelligence and the level of character. The great in
mind, it may be said briefly, are also great in spirit. "General
moral defect commonly involves intellectual inferiority. Woods and
Pearson find the correlation between intellect and character to
be about .5.... General moral defect is due in part to a generally
inferior nervous organization."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>Educational Psychology</i> (1910), p.
224.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
One other important correlation must be noted. While gifts and
capacities are specific, superiority in a given trait commonly
involves superiority in most others. Exceptional talent in one
direction in most cases involves exceptionality in many other respects.
While talents are not indiscriminately transferable from one field
to another, the same complex of traits which makes a person stand
out pre&euml;minently in a given field, say law, would make him
stand out in any one of half a dozen different fields into which he
might have gone. There seems to be no evidence that extraordinary
capacity in one direction is balanced by extraordinary incapacity
and stupidity in others. The fact that individuals differ not only
in specific traits but in general mental capacity has, also, certain
obvious practical consequences. It means that there are present in
society, in the light of recent tests in the army, an unexpectedly
large number of individuals below the level of normal intelligence.
One in five hundred, Thorndike estimates, is the "frequency of
intellectual ability so defective as to disturb the home, resist
school influence, and excite popular derision." These are clearly
liabilities in the social order. <a name="page_190"><span
class="page">Page 190</span></a> On the other hand, there is a
large number above the level of average intelligence. The importance
of this group for human progress can hardly be overestimated. As
we have seen in other connections, progress is contingent upon
variation from the "normal" or the accustomed, and such variation
from the normal is initiated in the majority of cases by members
of this comparatively small super-normal group. If civilization is
to advance it must capitalize its intelligence; that is, educate
up to the highest point of native ability. But in any case, its
chief guarantee of progress lies in the comparatively small group
in whom native ability is exceptionally high. For it is among this
group that original thinking, invention, and discovery almost
exclusively occur.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Causes of individual differences.</b> Among the chief causes of
individual differences may, in general, be set down the following:
(1) Sex, (2) Race, (3) Near Ancestry or Family, (4) Environment.
The particular fund of human nature which an individual displays,
that is, his specific native endowments, as they appear in practice,
will be a resultant of these various causes. In the study of each
of these characteristics, we should be able ideally to eliminate
all the others and to consider them each in isolation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The influence of sex.</b> In the case of sex, for example, we
should not confuse individual differences due to the fact of sex
with individual differences due to divergent training given to
each of the sexes. In scientific experiments to determine sex
differences in mental traits, there have been careful attempts to
eliminate everything but the factor of sex itself. Thus in Karl
Pearson's studies of fifty twin brothers and sisters, the factors
of ancestry and difference of training and age were practically
eliminated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In so far as allowance can be made for other contributing factors,
studies of individual differences due to sex have revealed, roughly
speaking, the following results. There have been, in the field
of sensory discrimination and accuracy of motor response,
slight&mdash;and negligible&mdash;differences of responses <a
name="page_191"><span class="page">Page 191</span></a> made by male
and female. The subjects stated were, in most cases, selected so
far as possible from the same social strata, social and intellectual
interest, and background.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: As, for example, the members of the graduating and
junior classes of the co-educational college at the University
of Chicago, studied by Dr. Thompson.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thorndike reports the general results of such tests as follows:
</p>

<p class="include">
The percentages of males reaching or exceeding the median ability of

<p class="include">
The most important characteristic of these differences is their
small amount. The individual differences within one sex so enormously
outweigh the differences between the sexes in these intellectual
and semi-intellectual traits that for practical purposes the sex
difference may be disregarded. So far as ability goes, there could
hardly be a stupider way to get two groups alike within each group
but differing between the groups than to take the two sexes. As is
well known, the experiments of the past generation in educating
women have shown their equal competence in school work of elementary,
secondary, and collegiate grade. The present generation's experience
is showing the same fact for professional education and business
<a name="page_192"><span class="page">Page 192</span></a> service.
The psychologists' measurements lead to the conclusion that this
equality of achievement comes from an equality of natural gifts,
not from an overstraining of the lesser talents of women.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>Educational Psychology</i>, briefer course,
pp. 345-46.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
That is, so far as experiments upon objectively measurable traits
have been conducted, the specific differences that individuals
display have comparatively nothing to do with the fact that an
individual happens to be a man or a woman. These experiments have
been conducted with boys and girls as young as seven, and with
men and women ranging up to the age of twenty-five.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: There seems, as might be expected to be, a slightly
higher differentiation between the two sexes after adolescence
than before.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
These experiments have been conducted to test sensory discrimination,
precision of motor response and some of the simpler types of judgment,
such as those involved in the solution of simple puzzles with blocks,
matches, etc. The fact of the negligibility of sex difference with
regard to certain minor measurable traits has been adequately
demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments. The fact of sex
equality or mental capacity has been less accurately but fairly
universally noted by popular consensus of observation and opinion
of the work of women in the various trades and professions. There
are differences between men and women in physical strength and
in consequent susceptibility to fatigue. These are important
considerations in qualifying the amount of work a woman can do
as compared with that of a man, and have justly resulted in the
regulation of hours for women, as a special class. But there do
not seem to be, on the average, significant original differences
in mental capacity.[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: On this subject there has been collected a large amount
of accurate experimental data. See Goldmark: <i>Fatigue and
Efficiency</i>, part II, pp. 1-22. These refer to physiological
differences.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There do exist, as a matter of practical fact, some of the special
attributes commonly ascribed to the masculine and feminine mental
life, but it is generally agreed by investigators that these are to
be accounted for by the different environment <a name="page_193"><span
class="page">Page 193</span></a> and standards socially established
for men and for women. There are radical and subtle differences in
training to which boys and girls are subjected from early childhood.
There are deeply fixed traditions as to the standards of action,
feeling, and demeanor to which boys and girls are respectively
trained and to which they are expected to conform. If a boy should
not live up to this training and expectation, he may be marked out
as "effeminate." If a girl does not conform, she is defined as a
"hoyden" or a "tomboy."
</p>

<p class="indent">
These social distinctions, which are emphasized even in the behavior
of young boys and young girls, grow more pronounced as individuals
grow older. One need hardly call attention to actions regarded as
perfectly legitimate for men which provoke disapproval if practiced
by women. Rigid training in these different codes of behavior may
cause acquired characteristics to seem inborn. But whether these
general features commonly held to distinguish the mental life of
man or woman are or are not intrinsic and original, they have been
marked out by certain investigators as socially fundamental. Thus
Heymans and Wiersma, two German investigators, set down as the
differentia of feminine mental life (1) greater activity, (2) greater
emotionality, (3) greater unselfishness of the female.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See Thorndike's <i>Educational Psychology</i> (1910),
p. 136.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are some general differences noted by both layman and
psychologist, which, though not subject to quantitative determination,
yet seem to differentiate somewhat definitely between feminine
and masculine mental activity. These may be set down in general
as occurring in the field of emotional susceptibility. Thorndike
traces them back to the varying intensity of two human traits earlier
discussed: the fighting instinct, relatively much stronger in the
male, and the nursing or mothering instinct, much stronger in the
female. With this fact are associated important differences in
the conduct of men and women in social relations. The maternal <a
name="page_194"><span class="page">Page 194</span></a> instinct
is held by some writers, for instance, to be in large measure the
basis of altruism, and is closely associated with sensitivity to
the needs and desires of others. Thorndike writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
It has been common to talk of women's dependence. This is, I am
sure, only an awkward name for less resentment at mastery. The
actual nursing of the young seems likewise to involve equally
unreasoning tendencies to pet, coddle, and "do for" others. The
existence of these two instincts has been long recognized by literature
and common knowledge, but their importance in causing differences
in the general activities of the two sexes has not. The fighting
instinct is in fact the cause of a very large amount of the world's
intellectual endeavor. The financier does not think merely for
money, nor the scientist for truth, nor the theologian to save
souls. Their intellectual efforts are aimed in great measure to
outdo the other man, to subdue nature, to conquer assent. The maternal
instinct in its turn is the chief source of woman's superiorities
in the moral life. The virtues in which she excels are not so much
due to either any general moral superiority or any set of special
moral talents as to her original impulses to relieve, comfort,
and console.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 48-49.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Ordinary observation reveals, as literature has in general recorded,
what Havelock Ellis has called the "greater affectability of the female
mind." There is evidenced in many women a singular and immediate
responsiveness to other people's emotions, a quick intuition, a
precise though non-logical discrimination, which, though shared to
some extent by all individuals gifted with sympathy and affection,
is a peculiarly feminine quality. Indeed when a man possesses it, it
is common to speak of him as possessing "almost a woman's intuition."
Such emotional susceptibility is manifested in the higher frequency
of emotional instability and emotional outbreaks among women than
among men, and the decreased power of inhibition which women have
over instinctive and emotional reactions. Further than this, women
more than men may be said to qualify their judgments of persons
and situations by their emotional reactions to them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The common suspicion that in general women's abilities are less than
those of men has seemed to gain strength from <a name="page_195"><span
class="page">Page 195</span></a> the greater number of geniuses
and eminent persons there have been among men than among women.
Professor Cattell writes in this connection:
</p>

<p class="include">
I have spoken throughout of eminent men as we lack in English words
including both men and women, but as a matter of fact women do not
have an important place on the list. They have in all thirty-two
representatives in the thousand. Of these eleven are hereditary
sovereigns, and eight are eminent through misfortunes, beauty,
or other circumstances. Belles-lettres and fiction&mdash;the only
department in which woman has accomplished much&mdash;give ten
names as compared with seventy-two men. Sappho and Joan d'Arc are
the only other women on the list. It is noticeable that with the
exception of Sappho&mdash;a name associated with certain fine
fragments&mdash;women have not excelled in poetry or art. Yet these
are the departments least dependent on environment, and at the same
time those in which the environment has been perhaps as favorable to
women as to men. Women depart less from the normal than men&mdash;a
fact that usually holds for the female throughout the animal series;
in many closely related species only the male can be readily
distinguished.[1]

<p class="indent">
In the facts of higher variability among males, and the hitherto
restricted social opportunities provided for women are to be found
the chief reasons for the comparatively high achievement of the male
sex as compared with the female. But on the average the difference
between the two sexes with respect to mental capacity is slight.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The influence of race.</b> A second factor in determining individual
differences in mental traits is race. There are certain popular
presuppositions as to the inherent differences in the mental activity
of different races. The Irishman's wit, the negro's joyousness, the
emotionality of the Latin races, the stolidity of the Chinese, are
all supposed to be fundamental. And in a sense they are. That is,
in the life and culture of these groups, such traits may stand out
distinctively. But most psychologists and anthropologists question
seriously whether these traits are to be traced to radical differences
<a name="page_196"><span class="page">Page 196</span></a> in racial
inheritance. For the most part they seem rather to be the result of
radical differences in environment. "Many of the mental similarities
of an Indian to Indians and of his differences from Anglo-Saxons
disappear, if he happens to be adopted and brought up as an
Anglo-Saxon."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 52.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There have been various experimental studies made to determine
how much divergences in the mental activity of different races are
determined by differences in racial inheritance. Such experiments
have been conducted chiefly upon very simple traits and capacities.
The accuracy of sensory response among different races has, for
example, been examined. There have proved to be, in regard to these,
slight differences in the effectiveness and accuracy of response.
There are racial differences in hearing, as tested by the ticking
of a watch or clock artificially made. In this test, Papuans, to
take an instance, were inferior to Europeans. The sense of touch
has been similarly tested, and comparatively negligible differences
have been found. In regard to the five senses, their efficiency
seems to be about equal in all the races of mankind. The proverbial
keenness of vision of the Indian, for example, is found to be due
to a superior training in its use, a training made imperative by
the conditions of Indian life. In reaction time tests&mdash;that is,
tests in the speed of simple mental and motor performances&mdash;the
time consumed in response has been found to be about the same for
all races tested. The results have been similar with regard to
certain simple processes of judgment or inference:
</p>

<p class="include">
There are a number of illusions and constant errors of judgment
which are well known in the psychological laboratory, and which
seem to depend, not on peculiarities of the sense organs, but on
quirks and twists in the process of judgment. A few of these have
been made the matter of comparative tests, with the result that
peoples of widely different cultures are subject to the same errors,
and in about the same degree. There is an illusion which occurs when
an object, which looks heavier than it is, is lifted by the hand;
it then feels, not only lighter than it looks, but even lighter
than it <a name="page_197"><span class="page">Page 197</span></a>
really is. The contrast between the look and the feel of the thing
plays havoc with the judgment. Women are, on the average, more
subject to this illusion than men. The amount of this illusion
has been measured in several peoples, and found to be, with one or
two exceptions, about the same in all. Certain visual illusions,
in which the apparent length or direction of a line is greatly
altered by the neighborhood of other lines, have similarly been
found present in all races tested, and to about the same degree.
As far as they go, these results tend to show that simple sorts
of judgment, being subject to the same disturbances, proceed in
the same manner among various peoples; so that the similarity of
the races in mental processes extends at least one step beyond
sensation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Woodworth: "Racial Differences in Mental Traits,"
<i>Science</i>, New Series, vol. 31, pp. 179-81.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Professor Woodworth also points out that these simple tests are
not adequate to measure general intelligence.
</p>

<p class="include">
A good test for intelligence would be much appreciated by the
comparative psychologist, since, in spite of equal standing in such
rudimentary matters as the senses and bodily movement, attention
and the simpler sorts of judgment, it might still be that great
differences in mental efficiency existed between different groups
of men. Probably no single test could do justice to so complex
a trait as intelligence. Two important features of intelligent
action are quickness in seizing the key to a novel situation, and
firmness in limiting activity to the right direction, and suppressing
acts which are obviously useless for the purpose in hand. A simple
test which calls for these qualities is the so-called "form test."
There are a number of blocks of different shapes, and a board with
holes to match the blocks. The blocks and board are placed before
a person, and he is told to put the blocks in the holes in the
shortest possible time. The key to the situation is here the matching
of blocks and holes by their shape; and the part of intelligence
is to hold firmly to this obvious necessity, wasting no time in
trying to force a round block into a square hole. The demand on
intelligence certainly seems slight enough; and the test would
probably not differentiate between a Newton and you or me; but it
does suffice to catch the feeble-minded, the young child, or the
chimpanzee, as any of these is likely to fail altogether, or at least
to waste much time in random moves and vain efforts. This test was
tried on representatives of several races and considerable differences
appeared. As between whites, Indians, Eskimos, Ainus, Filipinos,
and Singhalese, the average differences <a name="page_198"><span
class="page">Page 198</span></a> were small, and much overlapping
occurred. As between these groups, however, and the Igorot and
Negrito from the Philippines and a few reputed Pygmies from the
Congo, the average differences were great, and the overlapping
small.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Woodworth: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 171-86.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Equality among races in the various traits that have been measured
by psychologists does not imply that common observation is wrong
in counting one race as intellectually superior to another. There
have, as yet, been no measurements of such general features of
social life as energy, self-reliance, inventiveness, and the like.
But from indications of experiments already made, these so-called
(and for practical purposes genuine) intellectual differences between
the individuals of different races must be attributed to differences
in environment. Races <i>as</i> races seem to be equally gifted.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Professor Boas points out that civilized investigators traveling
among savage tribes commit one serious fallacy in insisting on
the inferiority of these primitive peoples. They are said to be
irrational, for example, when they are quite logical in their way
of dealing with the material which is at their disposal. Without
any scientific information available, for example, anthropomorphism,
or the tendency to interpret cosmic phenomena in human terms is
quite natural and reasonable. Again:
</p>

<p class="include">
The difference in the mode of thought of primitive man and that of
civilized man seems to consist largely in the difference of character
of the traditional material with which the new perception associates
itself. The instruction given to the child of primitive man is not
based on centuries of experimentation, but consists of the crude
experience of generations. When a new experience enters the mind of
primitive man, the same process which we observe among civilized
man brings about an entirely different series of associations, and
therefore results in a different type of explanation. A sudden
explosion will associate itself in his mind, perhaps, with the
tales he has heard in regard to the mythical history of the world,
and consequently will be accompanied by superstitious fear. When
we recognize that neither among civilized men nor among primitive
men the average individual carries to completion the attempt at
causal <a name="page_199"><span class="page">Page 199</span></a>
explanation of phenomena, but carries it only so far as to amalgamate
it with other previously known facts, we recognize that the result
of the whole process depends entirely upon the character of the
traditional material.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Boas: <i>Mind of Primitive Man</i>, pp. 203-04.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
This may be illustrated by our immediate reactions of pleasure or
disgust at customs or ideas that provoke directly opposite reactions
among races reared in another tradition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again primitive races have been accused of lacking self-control.
The fact is that they exhibit self-control about matters which
they regard as important, and lack of it in respect to matters
which they regard as trivial. "When an Eskimo community is on the
point of starvation, and their religious proscriptions forbid them
to make use of the seals that are basking on the ice, the amount
of self-control of the whole community which restrains them from
killing those seals is certainly very great."[2] The case is similar
with regard to nearly all the alleged inferiorities of primitive
man, his improvidence, unreliability, and the like. In nearly every
instance, it has been found that we are holding him to account
for not being able to persist in courses of action which do not
seem to him, with his training and education, worth persisting in,
and for not conforming to standards which, given his background,
are meaningless.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid</i>. p. 108.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But if differences in racial attainments are due to differences
in environment, it might be said that this itself is testimony to
the superiority of the race that has the more complex and exacting
environment. This is not by any means clearly the case. The "culture"
or civilization which a race exhibits is a very uncertain index
of its gifts or its capacities. The culture found in a race is,
it may be said without exaggeration, largely a matter of accident
or circumstance rather than of heredity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some of the environmental causes for differences in culture may he
explicitly noted. Any modern culture is the result of interminglings
of many different cross-streams and cross-borrowings. <a
name="page_200"><span class="page">Page 200</span></a> Races that
have long been isolated as, for example the African negroes, have
no possibility of picking up all the acquisitions to which races
that intermingle have access. Progress in the developments of arts,
sciences, and institutions depends on fortunate individual variations.
The smaller the race the less the number of variations possible,
including those on the side of what we call genius. Again fortunate
variations depend not so much on the general average intellectual
capacities of the race as on its variability. So one race may possess
a relative superiority of achievement because of its high variability,
just as, as we have already pointed out, the greater pre&euml;minence
of the male sex with regard to intellectual accomplishment is due
to the greater number of variations both above and below the norm
which it displays. The reasons for variability are again, according
to Professor Boas, largely environmental. "We have seen, when a
people is descended from a small uniform group, that then its
variability will decrease; while on the other hand, when a group
has a much-varied origin or when the ancestors belong to entirely
distinct types the variability may be considerably increased."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Boas; <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 93.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again a race may be placed in such geographical conditions that
a fortuitous variation on the part of one individual may prove of
enormous value in the development of its civilization. Or fortunate
geographical conditions may stimulate types of activity that lie
dormant, although possible, among other races. Thus by some
investigators the flexibility and emancipation of the Greek genius
were attributed to their access to the sea and their constant
intermingling with other cultures, especially the Egyptian.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the subject of the fundamental equality of races despite their
seeming disparity, as that at present, let us say, between whites
and negroes, Professor Boas writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
Much has been said of the hereditary characteristics of the Jews,
<a name="page_201"><span class="page">Page 201</span></a> of the
Gypsies, of the French and Irish, but I do not see that the external
and social causes which have moulded the character of members of these
people have ever been eliminated satisfactorily; and, moreover, I do
not see how this can be accomplished. A number of external factors that
influence body and mind may easily be named&mdash;climate, nutrition,
occupation&mdash;but as soon as we enter into a consideration of
social factors and mental conditions we are unable to tell definitely
what is cause and what is effect.

The conclusions reached are therefore, on the whole, negative. We
are not inclined to consider the mental organization of different
races of man as differing in fundamental points. Although, therefore,
the distribution of faculty among the races of man is far from being
known, we can say this much: the average faculty of the white race
is found to the same degree in a large proportion of individuals
of all other races, and although it is probable that some of these
races may not produce as large a proportion of great men as our
own race, there is no reason to suppose that they are unable to
reach the level of civilization represented by the bulk of our
own people.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Boas; <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 116, 123.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In contrast must be cited the opinions of a large class of psychologists
and anthropologists who are inclined to regard racial differences as
intrinsic and original. Of such, for example, is Francis Galton,
who claims in his <i>Hereditary Genius</i>, that taking negroes
on their own ground they still are inferior to Europeans by about
one eighth the difference, say, between Aristotle and the lowest
idiot. Recent psychological experiments in the army reveal, again,
certain fundamental intellectual inferiorities of negroes, though
whether this is environmental or to be traced to hereditary causes
is open to question.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fact remains that there are, despite the lack of evidence for
hereditary mental differences, practical differences in the mental
activity of different races that are of social importance. These
differences, which seem so fundamental, have been explained primarily
by the powerful control exercised over the individual by the habits
which he acquires even before the <a name="page_202"><span
class="page">Page 202</span></a> age of five years. These, though
unconscious, may be, as the Freudian psychologists maintain, all
the more important for that reason. This would appear to be the only
explanation of significant racial differences. Cultural differences
cannot, biologists are generally agreed, be transmitted in the
germs that pass from generation to generation. One may say, in
effect, that an individual is differentiated in his mental traits
by early association with a certain race, and by his immediate
ancestry or family, rather than by the fact of belonging physically
to a certain race.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The influence of immediate ancestry or family.</b> A factor
that is, on experimental evidence, rated to be of high importance
in the determination of the differences of the mental make-up of
human beings, is "immediate ancestry" or family. Stated in the
most simple and general terms this means that children of the same
parents tend to display marked likenesses in mental traits, and
to exhibit less variation among themselves than is exhibited in
the same number of individuals chosen at random. A great number of
experiments have been conducted to determine how far resemblances
in mental traits are due to common parentage. The correlation between
membership in the same family and resemblances of social traits
has been found to be uniformly high.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The inference was made that children of the same family would show
great resemblances in mental traits, when accurate experiments showed
marked similarity in physical traits under the same conditions.
The coefficient of correlation between brothers in the color of
the eye, is, according to the results obtained by Karl Pearson,
.52.[1] The coefficient of fraternal correlation in the case of
the cephalic index (ratio of width to length of head) is .40. The
correlation of hair <a name="page_203"><span class="page">Page
203</span></a> color is found to be .55. The fact of high correlation
between resemblance of physical traits and membership in the same
family is of crucial importance, because these traits are clearly
due to ancestry, and not to environmental differences. If physical
traits show such a correlation, it is likely that mental traits
will also, mental traits being ultimately dependent on the brain
and the nervous system, which are both affected by ancestry.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: These facts are based on the reports of Karl Pearson
in his <i>On the Laws of Inheritance in Man</i>. What is meant by
coefficient of correlation may be explained as follows: If the
coefficient of correlation between father and son is .3 and the
coefficient of correlation between brother and brother is .5 we
may say: a son on the average deviates from the general trend of
the population by .3 of the amount of his father's deviation, a
brother by .5 of the amount of his brother.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Measurements of measurable traits and observations of less objectively
measurable ones, have revealed that immediate ancestry is in itself
an influential factor in producing likenesses and differences among
men with respect to mental traits. One interesting case, interesting
because it was a test of a capacity that might be expected to be
largely environmental in its origins, was that of the spelling
abilities of children in the St. Xavier School in New York. Thorndike
thus reports the test:
</p>

<p class="include">
As the children of this school commonly enter at a very early age,
and as the staff and the methods of teaching remain very constant,
we have in the case of the 180 brothers and sisters included in the
600 children closely similar school training. Mr. Earle measured
the ability of any individual by his deviation from the average for
his grade and sex, and found the co-efficient of correlation between
children of the same family to be .50. That is, any individual is
on the average fifty per cent as much above or below the average
for his age and sex as his brother or sister.
</p>

<p class="include">
Similarities in home training might theoretically account for this,
but any one experienced in teaching will hesitate to attribute much
efficacy to such similarities. Bad spellers remain bad spellers though
their teachers change. Moreover, Dr. J. M. Rice in his exhaustive
study of spelling ability found little or no relationship between
good spelling and any one of the popular methods, and little or
none between poor spelling and foreign parentage. Yet the training
of a home where parents do not read or spell the language well
must be a home of relatively poor training for spelling. Cornman's
more careful study of spelling supports the view that ability to
spell is little influenced by such differences in school or home
training as commonly exist.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thorndike: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 78.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_204"><span class="page">Page 204</span></a> In general
the influence of heredity may be said far to outweigh the influence
of home training. In all the cases reported, the resemblances were
about the same in traits subject to training, and in those not
subject to training. Thus industry and conscientiousness and public
spirit, which are clearly affected by environment, show no greater
resemblance than such practically unmodifiable traits as memory,
original sensitiveness to colors, sounds, and distances.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The influence of parentage, it must be added, consists in the
transmission of specific traits, not of a certain "nature" as a
whole. There are in the germ and the ovum which constitute the
inheritance of each individual, certain determinant elements. The
elements that determine the original traits with which each individual
will be born vary, of course, in the germs produced by a single
parent less than among individuals chosen at random, but they vary
none the less. In this variation of the determining elements in
the germs of the same individual is to be found the cause of the
variation in the physical and mental traits among children of the
same parents.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since the determining elements, the unit characters that appear in
the sperm or ovum of each individual, do not appear uniformly even
in children of the same parents, brother and sister may resemble
each other in certain mental traits, and differ in others. "A pair
of twins may be indistinguishable in eye color and stature, but
be notably different in hair color and tests of intellect."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mental inheritance, as well as physical, is, then, organized in
detail. It is not the inheritance of gross total natures, but of
particular "mental traits." If we had sufficient data, we should be
able to analyze out the unit characters of an individual's mental
equipment, so as to be able to predict with some accuracy the mental
inheritance of the children of any two parents. In the case of
physical inheritance, the laws of the hereditary transmission of
any given traits are known in considerable detail. The detailed
quantitative investigations <a name="page_205"><span class="page">Page
205</span></a> of inheritance, following the general lines set by
Mendel, have given striking results.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Physical traits have been found to be analyzable into unit-characters
(that is, traits hereditarily transmitted as units), such as "curliness
of hair," "blue eyes," and the like. Mental traits, however, do
not seem analyzable into the fixed unit-characters prescribed by
the Mendelian laws of inheritance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The success which breeders have had in the control of the reproduction
of plants and animals, in the perpetuation of a stock of desirable
characteristics and the elimination of the undesirable, has given
rise to a somewhat analogous ideal in human reproduction. That
eugenics has at least its theoretical possibilities with regard to
physical traits, few biologists will question. However difficult
it may be in practice to regulate human matings on the exclusive
basis of the kind of offspring desired, it is a genuine biological
possibility. In a negative way, it has already in part been initiated
in the prevention of the marriage of some extreme types of the
physically unfit, by the so-called eugenic marriage laws in some
states in this country.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: There have been laws, as there is a fairly decided
public opinion, adverse to reproduction by the feeble-minded and
the morally defective. But (see Richardson: <i>The Etiology of
Arrested Mental Development</i>, p. 9) there have been a number
of cases of feeble-minded parents producing normal children.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But whether scientific regulation of marriages for the production
of eugenic offspring is feasible, even apart from the personal
and emotional questions involved, is open to question. No mental
trait such as vivacity, musical ability, mathematical talent, or
artistic sense, has been analyzed into such definitely transmissible
unit-characters as "blue eyes" and "curliness of hair." So many
unit-characters seem to be involved in any single mental trait
that it will be long before a complete analysis of the hereditary
invariable determinants of any single trait can be made.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is thus impossible to tell as yet with any security or precision
the biological components of any single mental trait. <a
name="page_206"><span class="page">Page 206</span></a> The evidence
at our disposal, however, does confirm us in the belief that one of
the most significant and certain causes of individual differences,
whether physical or mental, is immediate ancestry or family. Individuals
are made by what they are initially, and, as we shall presently see,
therefore largely by their inheritance. With the latter, environment
can do just so much, and no more. And the most significant and
effective part of an individual's inheritance is his family for
some generations back, rather than the race to which he belongs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The influence of the environment.</b> Those factors so far discussed
which determine individual differences are independent of the particular
conditions of life in which an individual happens to be placed. An
individual's race, sex, family are beyond modification by anything that
happens to him after birth. Maturity, in so far as it is mere growth
independent of training, is also largely a fixed and unmodifiable
condition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The original nature, determined by race, sex, and immediate ancestry,
with which a man starts life is subject to modification by his
social environment, by the ideas, customs, companions, beliefs,
by which he is surrounded, and with which he comes continuously
in contact. Commonly the influence of environment is held to be
very high. It is difficult, however, accurately to distinguish
between effects which are due to original nature and effects which
are due to environment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Differences in training are important, but the results vary with
the natures trained. Precisely the same environment will not have
the same consequences for two different natures. Two approximately
same natures will show something like the same effects in dissimilar
environments. Human beings are certainly differentiated by the
customs, laws, ideals, friends, and occupations to which they are
exposed. But what the net result will be in a specific case, depends
on the individual's equipment to start with, an equipment that is
fixed before the environment has had a chance to act at all. <a
name="page_207"><span class="page">Page 207</span></a> The kindliness
and indulgence that save some children demoralize others. In some
people a soft answer turneth away wrath; in others it will kindle it.
Andrew Carnegie starts as a bobbin boy, and becomes a millionaire;
but there were many other bobbin boys. The sunset that stirs in one
man a lyric, leaves another cold. The same course in biology arouses
in one student a passion for a life of science; it leaves another
hoping never to see a microscope again. On the other hand, the same
types of original capacity thrown into different environments will
yet attain somewhat comparable results, in the way of character and
achievement. The biographies of a few poets, painters, philosophers,
and scientists chosen at random, show the most diverse antecedents.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Taking the social and professional status of a
distinguished man's father as some index of the social environment
to which he was subjected during his youth, we find some interesting
examples: The father of John Keats was a livery stable-keep; his
mother the daughter of one. Byron's father was a captain in the
Royal Guards; his mother a Scottish heiress. Newton's father was
a tanner; Pasteur's, a tanner; Darwin's, a doctor of considerable
means. Francis Bacon's father was Lord Keeper of the Great Seal;
Newton's was a farmer and the headmaster of a school; Turner was
the son of a barber.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
An individual, again, to a certain extent, makes his own environment.
What kind of an environment he will make depends on the kinds of
capacities and interests he has to start with. Similarity of original
tendencies and interests brings men together as differences among these
keep them apart. The libraries, the theaters, and the baseball parks
are all equally possible and accessible features of their environment
to individuals of a given economic or social class. Yet a hundred
individuals with the same education and social opportunities will
make themselves by choice a hundred different environments. They
will select, even from the same physical environment, different
aspects. The Grand Ca&ntilde;on is a different environment to the
artist and to the geologist; a crowd of people at an amusement
park constitutes a different environment to the man who has come out
to make psychological observations, and the man who has come out
for a day's fun. A dozen men, teachers and <a name="page_208"><span
class="page">Page 208</span></a> students, selected at random on a
university campus, might well be expected to note largely different
though overlapping facts, as the most significant features of the
life of the university.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The environment is the less important in the moulding of character,
the less fixed and unavoidable it becomes. If an individual has the
chance to change his environment to suit his own original demands
and interests, these are the less likely to undergo modification.
This is illustrated in the animal world by the migratory birds,
which change their habitations with the seasons. Similarly human
beings, to suit the original mental traits with which they are
endowed, can and do exchange one environment for another. There
are a very large number of individuals living in New York City,
in the twentieth century, for example, for whom a multiplicity
of environments are possible. The one that becomes habitual with
an individual is a matter of his own free choice. That is, it is
choice, in the sense that it is independent of the circumstances of
the individual's life. But an individual's choice of his environment
must be within the limited number of alternatives made possible
by the original nature with which he is endowed. As pointed out
in connection with our discussion of "Instinctive Behavior," we
do originally what gives satisfaction to our native impulses, and
avoid what irritates and frustrates them. We may be trained to
find satisfactions in acquired activities, but there is a strong
tendency to acquire habits that "chime in," as it were, with the
tendencies we have to start with.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is, for example, to certain individuals, intrinsic satisfaction
in form and color; to others in sound. To the former, pictures
and paintings will tend to be the environment selected; to the
latter the hearing and the playing of music. To those gifted with
sensitivity in neither of these directions, pictures may be through
all their lives a bore, and a piano a positive nuisance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These facts of original nature, therefore, determine initially,
<a name="page_209"><span class="page">Page 209</span></a> and
consequently in large part, what our environment is going to be.
Once we get into, or select through instinctive desires, a certain
kind of environment, those desires become strengthened through
habit, and that environment becomes fixed through fulfilling those
habitual desires. A man may, in the first place, choose artists
or scholars as companions because his own gifts and interests are
similar. But such an environment will become the more indispensable
for him when it has the reinforcement of habit to confirm what is
already initially strong in him by birth. "To him who hath shall be
given" is most distinctly true of the opportunities and environment
open to those with native gifts to begin with.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Original nature thus sets the scope and the limits of an individual's
character and achievement. It tells "how much" and, in the most
general way, "what" his capacities are. Thus a man born with a
normal vocal apparatus can speak; a man born with normal vision
can see. But what language he shall speak, and what sights he shall
see, depend on the social and geographical situation in which he
happens to be placed. Again, if a man is born with a "high general
intelligence," that is, with keen sensory discriminations and motor
responses, precise and accurate powers of analysis of judgment, a
capacity for the quick and effective acquisition and modification of
habits, we can safely predict that he will excel in some direction.
But whether he will stand out as a lawyer, doctor, philosopher,
poet, or executive, it is almost impossible from original nature
to tell.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The psychological tests used in the army, and being
used now with modifications in the admission of students to Columbia
College, are "general intelligence" tests. That is, they show general
alertness and intellectual promise, but are not prophetic of any
specialized talents or capacities.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Individual differences&mdash;Democracy and education.</b> The
fact that individuals differ in ability and interest has important
consequences for education and social progress. It means, in the first
place, that while current optimistic doctrines about the modifiability
of human nature are true, they are true within limits&mdash;limits that
vary with the individual. <a name="page_210"><span class="page">Page
210</span></a> Whether or not we shall ever succeed, through the
science or the practice of eugenics, in eliminating low ability
and perpetuating high exclusively, the fact remains that there are
in contemporary society the widest variations both in the kinds
of interest and ability displayed, and in their relative efficacy
under present social and industrial conditions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, it must be noted at the outset, a not inconsiderable
number of individuals who must be set down as absolute social
liabilities. Even if existing social and educational arrangements
were perfect, these would remain unaffected and unavailable for
any useful purpose. They would have to be endowed, cared for, or
confined. There is the quite considerable class, who, while normal
with respect to sensory and motor discrimination, seem to be seriously
and irremediably defective in their powers of judgment. These also
seem to offer invulnerable resistance to education, and their original
natures would not be subject to modification even by an education
perfectly adapted to the needs of normal people.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the more significant fact, more significant because it affects
so many, is the fact that within the ranks of the great class of
normal people, there are fundamental inherited differences in ability
and interest. Next in importance to the fact that an individual is
human is the fact that he is an individual, with very specific initial
capacities and desires. For education the implications are serious.
Education aims, among other things, to give the individual habits
that will enable him to deal most effectively with his environment.
But an individual can be trained best, it goes without saying,
in the capacities and interests he has to begin with. Education
cannot, therefore, be wholesale in its methods. It must be so adjusted
as to utilize and make the most of the multifarious variety of
native abilities and interests which individuals display. If it
does not utilize these, and instead sets up arbitrary moulds to
which individuals must conform, it will be crushing and distorting
the specific native activities which are the only raw material
it has to work upon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_211"><span class="page">Page 211</span></a> There have
not as yet been many detailed quantitative studies of individual
differences that would enable educators, if they were free to do
so, scientifically to adapt education to specific needs and
possibilities. Beginnings in this direction are being made, though
rather in advanced than in more elementary education. Professional
and trade schools, and group-electives in college courses are attempts
in this direction. Any attempt, of course, to adapt education to
specific needs and interests, instead of crushing them into <i>a
priori</i> moulds, requires, of course, a wider social recognition
and support of education than is at present common. For individual
differences require attention. And where millions are to be educated,
individual attention requires an immense investment in teaching
personnel.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But in this utilization of original interests and capacities lies
the only possibility of genuinely effective education.[1] In the
first place to try in education to give individuals habits for
which they have no special innate tendencies to begin with, is
costly. Secondly, to train individuals for types of life or work
for which their gifts and desires are ill adapted is to promote
at once inefficiency and unhappiness. One reason why the chance
to identify one's life with one's work (as is the case with the
artist and the scholar) is so universally recognized as good fortune,
is because it is so rare. A general and indiscriminate training
of men, as if they were all fitted with the same talents and the
same longings, does as much as underpayment or overwork to impair
the quality of the work done and the satisfaction derived from
it.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: A beginning in the application of this principle has
been made by the vocational guidance and employment management work
which is being done with increasing scientific accuracy throughout
the United States. Individual differences and interests are studied
with a view to putting "the right man in the right place." This slogan
is borrowed from the Committee on Classification and Personnel, which
during the Great War, through its trade tests and other machinery
of differentiation, utilized for the national welfare the specific
abilities of thousands of drafted men.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It has latterly been recognized that industry offers the crucial
opportunity to utilize to the fullest individual differences. <a
name="page_212"><span class="page">Page 212</span></a> By "getting
the right man in the right place," we at once get the work done
better and make the man better satisfied. If adequate attention
is given to "placement," to the specific demands put upon men by
specific types of work, and to the specific capacities of individuals
for fulfilling those demands, we will be capitalizing variations
among men instead of being handicapped by them. As it is, specific
differences do exist, and men enter occupations and professions
ignoring them. As a result both the job and the man suffer; the
former is done poorly, and the latter is unsuccessful and unhappy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be noted that the existence of specific differences between
individuals does not altogether, or often even in part, imply
superiority or inferiority. It implies in each case inferiority
or superiority with respect to the performance of a particular
type of work. Whether scientific insight and accuracy is better
than musical skill, whether a gift for salesmanship surpasses a gift
for mathematics, depends on the social situation and the standards
that happen to be current among the group. An intensely disagreeable
person may be the best man for a particular job. All scientific
observation can do is to note individual differences, to note what
work makes demands upon what capacities, and try to bring the man
and the job together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be emphasized that, while individual capacities determine
what an individual can do, social ideals and traditions determine
what he will do, because they determine what he will be rewarded and
encouraged to do. There is no question but that in our industrial
civilization certain types of ability, that of the organizer, for
example, have a high social value. There is no question but that
there are other abilities, which under our present customs and
ideals we reward possibly beyond their merit, as, to take an extreme
case, that of a championship prize fighter. We can through education
and vocational guidance utilize all native capacities. To make
provision for the utilization of all native <a name="page_213"><span
class="page">Page 213</span></a> capacities is to have an efficient
social life. But to what end our efficient human machinery shall
be used depends on the ideals and customs and purposes that happen
to be current in the social order at any given time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the words of Professor Thorndike, "we can invest in profitable
enterprises the capital nature provides." But what profiteth a
man or a society, is a matter for reflective determination; it is
not settled for us, as are our limitations, at birth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The net result of scientific observation in this field is the discovery,
in increasingly precise and specific form, that men are most diverse
and unequal in interest and capacity. The ideal of equality comes to
mean, under scientific analysis, equality of opportunity, leveling
all social inequalities; the fact of natural inequalities and
divergences remains incontestable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There may even be, as recent psychological tests seem to indicate,
a certain proportion of individuals who are not competent to take
an intelligent part in democratic government, who, having too little
intellectual ability to follow the simplest problem needing
co&ouml;perative and collective decision, must eternally be governed
by others. If these facts come to be authenticated by further data,
it merely emphasizes the fact that in a country professedly democratic
it is essential to devise an education that will, in the case of
each individual, educate up to the highest point of native ability.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where a country is ostensibly democratic, a few informed citizens
will govern the many uninformed, unless the latter are educated
to an intelligent knowledge and appreciation of their political
duties and obligations. Furthermore, the citizens of a community
who are prevented from using their native gifts will be both useless
and unhappy. Certainly this is an undesirable condition in a society
where all individuals are expected, so far as possible, to be ends
in themselves and not merely means for the ends of others.

CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="subtitle">LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION[1]</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Much of the technical material for this chapter is
drawn from Leonard Bloomfield's <i>The Study of Language</i>, and
W. D. Whitney's <i>The Life and Growth of Language</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It was earlier pointed out that human beings alone possess language.
They alone can make written symbols and heard sounds stand for
other things, for objects, actions, qualities, and ideas. In this
chapter the consideration of language may best be approached from
the spoken tongue, under the influence of which, except in the
simplest type of pictorial writing, the written form develops.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Bloomfield: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 7-8.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the point of view of the student of behavior, language, spoken
language especially, is a habit, acquired like walking or swimming.
It is made possible primarily by the fact that human beings possess
a variety and flexibility of vocal reflexes possessed by no other
animal. All the higher animals have a number of vocal reflexes, which
are called out primarily in the expression of emotion or desire.
Cries of pain, hunger, rage, sex desire or desire for companionship,
are common to a great number of the animal species. But these cries
and vocal utterances are limited, and comparatively unmodifiable.
They are moreover expressed, so far as experimental observation
can reveal, with no consciousness of the specific significance
of particular sounds and are used as the involuntary expression
of emotion rather than as a specific means of communication.
</p>

<p class="include">
... The primates have a much larger number of such vocal instincts
than the other mammals, and a much larger number of stimuli can
call them out, <i>e.g.</i>, injury to bodily tissue calls out one
group; hunger calls out a certain group; sex stimuli (mate, etc.)
another; and similarly cold, swiftly moving objects, tones, strange
animals <a name="page_215"><span class="page">Page 215</span></a>
call out others. When attachments are formed between the female
and her offspring another large group is called into action. There
is no evidence to show in the case of mammals that these vocal
instincts are modified by the sounds of other animals.... These
throat habits may be cultivated to such an extent in birds that
we may get an approximation, more or less complete, to a few such
habits possessed by the human being. Such throat habits, however,
are not language habits.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Watson: <i>Behavior</i>, p. 323.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In human beings language, it is clear, may attain extraordinary
refinement and complexity, and may convey extremely fine shades
and subtleties of emotion or idea. This results from the fact that
man is born with a vocal apparatus far superior in development
to that of any of the animals.
</p>

<p class="include">
It is pretty clear that the mutant man, when thrown off from the
primate stock, sprang forth with a vocal apparatus different from that
of the parent stock, and possessing abundant richness in reflexes, even
far surpassing that found in the bird. It is interesting to observe,
too, in this connection, that within the narrow space occupied by
the vocal apparatus we have a system of muscular mechanisms which
has within it, looking at it now as a whole, the same possibilities
of habit formation that we find in the remaining portion of bodily
musculature.... It is probable that in a few years we shall undertake
the study of such habits from exactly the same standpoint that we
now employ in studies upon the acquisition of skill in the human
being.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 323-24.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The human baby starts its expressive habits by emitting with wide-open
mouth an undifferentiated shriek of pain. A little later it yells
in the same way at any kind of discomfort. It begins before the end
of the first year to croon when it is contented. As it grows older
it begins to make different sounds when it experiences different
emotions. And with remarkable rapidity its repertoire of articulatory
movements has greatly increased.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Speech that begins in the child as a mere vague vocal expression
of emotion soon begins to exhibit a marked element of mimicry. The
child begins to associate the words uttered <a name="page_216"><span
class="page">Page 216</span></a> by his nurse or parents with the
specific objects they point to. He comes to connect "milk," "sleep,"
"mother" with the experiences to which they correspond. The child
thus learns to react to certain sounds as significant of certain
experiences. Unlike Adam, he does not have to give names to animals,
or for that matter to anything else on earth. They all have specific
names in the particular language in which he happens to be brought
up. In the case of other habits, largely through trial and error,
he learns to associate given sounds expressed by other people about
him with given experiences, pleasant or unpleasant. He learns further
to imitate, so far as possible, these sounds, as a means of more
precisely communicating his wants or securing their fulfillment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In this connection students of language frequently have raised the
question of how man first came to associate a given sound-sequence
with a given experience. Like fire, language was once conceived to
be a divine gift. Another theory postulated a genius who took it
into his head to give the things of earth their present inevitable
names. One other theory equally dubious held that language started
in onomatopoetic expressions like "Bow-wow," for dog. Still another
hypothesis once highly credited held that the sounds first uttered
were the immediate and appropriate expressions called out by particular
types of emotional experience. The validity of the last two theories
has been rendered particularly dubious. The very instances of imitative
words cited, words like "cuckoo," "crash," "flash," were, in their
original forms, quite other than they are now. And that words are
not immediately apposite expressions of the emotions which they
represent, has been generally recognized. In gesture language,
the gesture has to remain fairly imitative or expressive to be
intelligible. But an examination of half a dozen casual words in
contemporary languages shows how arbitrary are the signs used, and
how little appositeness or relevance they bear in their sound to
the sense which they represent. The detailed study of the perfectly
regular changes that so <a name="page_217"><span class="page">Page
217</span></a> largely characterize the evolution of language,
have revealed the inadequacy of any of these views. There seems to
be, in fact, no explanation of the origin of the language any more
than there is of the origin of life. All that linguistic science
can do is to reveal the history of language. And in this history,
human language stands revealed as a highly refined development of
the crude and undifferentiated expressions which, under emotional
stress, are uttered by all the animals.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Language as a social habit.</b> Language, as has repeatedly
been pointed out, is essentially social in character. It is, in
the first place, primarily an instrument of communication between
individuals, and is cultivated as such. In human speech, interjections
like "Oh!" or "Ah!" are still involuntary escapes of emotion, but
language develops as a vehicle of communication to others rather
than as a mere emotional outlet for the individual. Even if it
were possible for the mythical man brought up in solitude on a
desert island to have a language, it is questionable whether he
would use it. Since language is a way of making our wants, desires,
information known to others, it is stimulated by the presence of
and contact with others. Excess vitality may go into shouting or
song,[1] but language as an instrument of specific utterance comes
to have a more definite use and provocation. Man, as already pointed
out, is a highly gregarious animal, and language is his incomparable
instrument for sharing his emotions and ideas and experience with
others. The whole process of education, of the transmission of
culture from the mature to the younger members of a society, is
made possible through this instrument, whereby achievements and
traditions are preserved and transmitted in precise and public
terms.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Human song is by some linguistic experts, including
Bloomfield, held to have originated in the chant of rhythmic labor,
as in rowing or threshing.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Secondly, language is social in that, for the individual at least,
it is socially acquired. The child first imitates sounds without
any consciousness of their meaning, just as he imitates <a
name="page_218"><span class="page">Page 218</span></a> other actions
in sheer "physiological sympathy." But he learns soon, by watching
the actions of other people, that given sounds are always performed
when these others do given actions. He learns that some sounds are
portents of anger and punishment; still others of satisfaction
and pleasure. He learns soon to specify his utterances, to use
sounds as specific stimuli, to attain through other people specific
satisfactions. The child is born with a flexible set of reflexes. In
which way they shall be developed depends entirely on the accident
of the child's environment. Whether he shall call it "bread" or
"pain" or "brod," depends on the particular social environment in
which he from the first hears that particular item of experience
referred to. A child of American missionaries in Turkey picks up
the language of that country as well as that of his own. An English
child brought up under a French nurse may learn with perfect ease
the foreign tongue, and to the exclusion of that of his native
country. Indeed, so completely subject is one in this regard to
one's early environment, that it is not only difficult in later
life to acquire a new pronunciation, but one finds it impossible to
breathe freely, as it were, in the whole psychological atmosphere
of a foreign language. Its grammatical categories, its spelling,
its logic seem hopelessly irrational. It was perfectly natural
of the Englishman in the story, when he was told that the French
called it "pain," to insist, "Well, it's bread, anyhow." Many a
reader of a foreign language which has become habitual can still not
refrain from translating, as he reads, what seem to him irrational
idioms into the familiar, facile, and sensible modes of his native
tongue.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Language and mental life.</b> The connection of language with
thought has repeatedly been noted. It has even been questioned whether
thought in any effective sense is possible without words. In general
it may be said that thinking demands clean-cut and definite symbols
to work with, and that language offers these in incomparable form.
A word enables one to isolate in thought the dominant elements of an
experience <a name="page_219"><span class="page">Page 219</span></a>
and prevents them from "slipping through one's fingers."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The importance of having words by which concepts may be distinguished
and isolated from one another will become clearer by a brief reminder
of the nature of reflection. Thinking is in large part (as will be
discussed in detail in chapter XIII) concerned with the breaking-up
of an experience into its significant elements. But experience begins
with objects, and so far as perceptual experience is concerned,
ends there. We perceive objects, not qualities, actions, or ideas
apart from objects. And the elements into which thinking analyzes
an experience are never present, save in connection with, as parts
of, a sensibly perceived object. Thus we never perceive whiteness
save in white objects; warmth save in warm objects; red save in
red objects. We never, for that matter, perceive so abstract a
thing as an "object." We experience red houses or red flags; white
flowers, white shoes, white paper; warm stoves, warm soup, and
warm plates. Even houses and stoves and shoes are, in a sense,
abstractions. No two of these are ever alike. But it is of the
highest importance for us to have some means of identifying and
preserving in memory the significant resemblances between our
experiences. Else we should be, as it were, utterly astounded every
time we saw a chair or a table or a fork. Though they may, in each
case in which we experience them, differ in detail, chairs, tables,
forks have certain common features which we can "abstract" from the
gross total experience, and by a word or "term," define, record,
communicate, and recall. The advantage of a precise technical vocabulary
over a loose "popular" one is that we can by means of the former
more accurately single out the specific and important elements of
an experience and distinguish them from one another. The common
nouns, or "general names" in a language indicate to what extent
and in what manner that language, through some or other of its
users, classifies its experiences. Highly developed languages make
it possible to classify similarities <a name="page_220"><span
class="page">Page 220</span></a> not easily detected in crude
experience. They make it possible to identify other things than
merely directly sensed objects.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In primitive languages experience is described and classified only
in so far as it is perceptual. In other words, primitive languages
have names for objects only, not for ideas, qualities, or relations.
Thus it is impossible in some Indian languages to express the concept
of a "brother" by the same word, unless the "brother" is in every
case in the same identical circumstances. One cannot use the same
word for "man" in different relations: "man-eating," "man-sleeping,"
"man-standing-here," and "man-running-there" would all be separate
compound words. Among the Fuegians there is one word which means
"to look at one another, hoping that each will offer to do something
which both parties desire but are unwilling to do."[1] Marett writes
in this connection:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Marett: <i>Anthropology</i>, p. 140.]
</p>

<p class="include">
Take the inhabitants of that cheerless spot, Tierra del Fuego,
whose culture is as rude as that of any people on earth. A scholar
who tried to put together a dictionary of their language found that
he had got to reckon with more than thirty thousand words, even
after suppressing a large number of forms of lesser importance.
And no wonder that the tally mounted up. For the Fuegians had more
than twenty words, some containing four syllables, to express what
for us would be either "he" or "she"; then they had two names for
the sun, two for the moon, and two more for the full moon, each of
the last named containing four syllables and having no elements
in common.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 138-39.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is easy to see how very little refinement or abstraction from
experience could be made with such a cumbersome and inflexible
vocabulary. The thirty thousand word vocabulary expressed a poverty
of linguistic technique rather than a richness of ideas.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At the other extreme stands a language like English, which is, to
an extraordinary degree, an "analytic" language. It has comparatively
no inflections. This means that words can be used and moved about
freely in different situations and relations. <a name="page_221"><span
class="page">Page 221</span></a> Thus the dominant elements of an
experience can be freely isolated. A noun standing for a certain
object or relation is not chained to a particular set of accompanying
circumstances. "Man" stands as a definite concept, whether it be
used with reference to an ancient Greek, a wounded man, a brave, a
wretched, a competent, or a tall man. We can give the accompanying
circumstances by additional adjectives, which are again freely
movable verbally and intellectually. Thus we can speak of a brave
child and a tall tower as well as a brave man and a tall man. In
Marett's words:
</p>

<p class="include">
The evolution of language then, on this view, may be regarded as
a movement away from the holophrastic [compound] in the direction
of the analytic. When every piece in your playbox of verbal bricks
can be dealt with separately, because it is not joined on in all
sorts of ways to the other pieces, then only can you compose new
constructions to your liking. Order and emphasis, as is shown by
English, and still more conspicuously by Chinese, suffice for
sentence-building. Ideally, words should be individual and atomic.
Every modification they suffer by internal change of sound, or by
having prefixes or suffixes tacked on to them, involves a curtailment
of their free use and a sacrifice of distinctness. It is quite
easy, of course, to think confusedly, even whilst employing the
clearest type of language.... On the other hand, it is not feasible
to attain a high degree of clear thinking, when the only method of
speech available is one that tends toward wordlessness&mdash;that
is to say, one that is relatively deficient in verbal forms that
preserve their identity in all contexts.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Marett: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 141-42.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Languages differ not only in being more or less analytic, but in
their general modes of classification. That is, not only do they
have more or less adequate vocabularies, but in their syntax, their
sentence structure, their word forms, they variously organize
experience. It is important to note that in these divergent
classifications no one of them is more final than another. We are
tempted, despite this fact, to think that the grammar, spelling,
and phonetics of our own language constitute the last word in the
rational conveyance of thought.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_222"><span class="page">Page 222</span></a> <b>The
instability of language.</b> Language being a social habit, it is
to be expected that it should not stay fixed and changeless. The
simpler physiological actions are not performed in the same way
by any two individuals, and no social practice is ever performed
in the same way by two members of a group, or by two different
generations. In this connection writes Professor Bloomfield:
</p>

<p class="include">
The speech of former times, wherever history has given us records
of it, differs from that of the present. When we read Shakspere, for
example, we are disturbed by subtle deviations from our own habits
in the use of words and in construction; if our actors pronounced
their lines as Shakspere and his contemporaries did we should say that
they had an Irish or German brogue. Chaucer we cannot read without
some grammatical explanation or a glossary; correctly pronounced
his language would sound to us more like Low German than like our
English. If we go back only about forty generations from our time
to that of Alfred the Great, we come to English as strange to us as
modern German, and quite unintelligible, unless we study carefully
both grammar and lexicon.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bloomfield: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 195.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, in general, three kinds of changes that take place in a
language. "Phonetic" changes, that is, changes in the articulation of
words, regardless of the meaning they bear. This is illustrated simply
by the word "name" which, in the eighteenth century was pronounced
ne'm. " Analogic" changes, that is, changes in the articulation of
words under the influence of words somewhat similar in meaning.
The word "flash," for example, became what it is because of the
sound of words associated in meaning, "crash," "dash," "smash." The
third process of change in language alters not only the articulate
forms of words, not only their sound, but their sense. All these
changes, as will be presently pointed out, can easily be explained
by the laws of habit early discussed in this book, these laws being
applicable to the habit of language as well as to any other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the case of phonetic change, it is only to be expected that
the sounds of a language will not remain eternally changeless. <a
name="page_223"><span class="page">Page 223</span></a> A language
is spoken by a large number of individuals, no two of whom are
gifted with precisely the same vocal apparatus. In consequence
no two of them will utter words in precisely the same way. Before
writing and printing were general, these slight variations in
articulation were bound to have an effect on the language. People
more or less unconsciously imitate the sounds they hear, especially
if they are not checked up by the written forms of words. Even to-day
changes are going on, and writing is at best a poor representation
of phonetics. The Georgian, the Londoner, the Welshman and the
Middle Westerner can understand the same printed language, precisely
because it does not at all represent their peculiarities of dialect.
Variant sounds uttered by one individual may be caught up in the
language, especially if the variant articulation is simpler or
shorter. Thus the shortening of a word from several syllables to
one, though it starts accidentally, is easily made habitual among
a large number of speakers because it does facilitate speech. In
the classic example, pre-English, "habeda" and "habedun" became in
Old English, "h&aelig;fde" and" h&aelig;fdon," and are in present
English (I, we) "had."[1] In the same way variations that reduce
the unstressed syllables of a word readily insinuate themselves
into the articulatory habits of a people. In the production of
stressed syllables, the vocal chords are under high tension and
the breath is shut in. It is easier, consequently, to produce the
unstressed syllables "with shortened, weakened articulations...
lessening as much as possible all interference with the breath
stream."[2] Thus "contemporaneous prohibition" becomes "k?temp?'?ejnj?s
p?h?'bif?." Sound changes thus take place, in general, as lessenings
of the labor of articulation, by means of adaptation to prevailing
rest positions of the vocal organs. They take place further in more
or less accidental adaptations to the particular speech habits of
a people. That is, those sounds become discarded that do not fit in
with the general articulatory tendencies of <a name="page_224"><span
class="page">Page 224</span></a> a language. Of this the weakening
of unstressed syllables in English and palatalization in Slavic
are examples.[1*]

<p class="indent">
These changes of sound in language so far discussed are made
independently of the meaning of words. Other changes in articulation
occur, as already noted, by analogy of sound or meaning. That is,
words that have associated meanings come to be similarly articulated.
This is simply illustrated in the case of the child who thinks it
perfectly natural to assimilate by analogy "came" to "come." Thus
the young child will frequently say, until he is corrected, he
"comed," he "bringed," he "fighted." In communities where printing
and writing and reading are scarce, such assimilation by analogy
has an important effect in modifying the forms of words.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Changes in meaning.</b> The changes in language most important
for the student of human behavior are changes in meaning. Language,
it must again be stressed, is an instrument for the communication
of ideas. The manner in which the store of meanings in a language
becomes increased and modified (the etymology of a language) is,
in a sense, the history of the mental progress of the people which
use it. For changes in meaning are primarily brought about when
the words in a language do not suffice for the larger and larger
store of experiences which individuals within the group desire to
communicate to one another. The meanings of old words are stretched,
as it were, to cover new experiences; old words are transferred
bodily to new experiences; they are slightly modified in form to
apply to new experiences analogous to the old; new words are formed
after analogy with ones already in use.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A simple illustration of the application of a word already current
to a wider situation is the application of the word "head" as a purely
objective name, to a new experience, which has certain analogies
with the old; as when we speak of a "head" of cabbage, the" head"
of an army, the "head" <a name="page_225"><span class="page">Page
225</span></a> of the class, or the "headmaster." In many such cases
the transferred meaning persists alongside of the old. Thus the word
"capital" used as the name for the chief city in a country, persists
alongside of its use in "capital" punishment, "capital" story, etc.
But sometimes the transferred meaning of the word becomes dominant
and exclusive. Thus "disease" (dis-ease) once meant discomfort of
any kind. Now it means specifically some physical ailment. The
older use has been completely discarded. To "spill" once meant,
in the most general sense, to destroy. Now all the other uses,
save that of pouring out, have lapsed. "Meat" which once meant
any kind of nourishment has now come to refer almost exclusively
(we still make exceptions as in the case of sweetmeat) to edible
flesh. Whenever the special or novel application of the word becomes
dominant, then we say the meaning of the word has changed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mental progress is largely dependent on the transfer of words to
newer and larger spheres of experience, the modification of old words
or the formation of new ones to express the increasing complexity of
relations men discover to exist between things. In the instances
already cited some of the transferred words lost their more general
meaning and became specialized, as in the case of "meat," "spill,"
etc. Other words, like "head," though they may keep their specific
objective meaning, may come to be used in a generalized intellectual
sense. One of the chief ways by which a language remains adequate to
the demands of increasing knowledge and experience of the group is
through the transfer of words having originally a purely objective
sense to emotional and intellectual situations. These words, like
"bitter," "sour," "sharp," referring originally only to immediate
physical experiences, to objects perceived through the senses, come
to have intellectual and emotional significance, as when we speak
of a "sour" face, a "bitter" disappointment, a "sharp" struggle.
Most of our words that now have abstract emotional or intellectual
connotations were once words referring <a name="page_226"><span
class="page">Page 226</span></a> exclusively to purely sensible
(sense perceptual) experiences. "Anxiety" once meant literally a
"narrow place," just as when we speak of some one having "a close
shave." To "refute" once meant literally "to knock out" an argument.
To "understand" meant "to stand in the midst of." To "confer" meant
"to bring together." Sensation words themselves were once still more
concrete in their meaning. "Violet" and "orange" are obviously taken
as color names from the specific objects to which they still refer.
Language has well been described as "a book of faded metaphors."
The history of language has been to a large extent the assimilation
and habitual mechanical use of words that were, when first used,
strikingly figurative.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The novel use of a word that is now a quite regular part of the
language may in many cases first be ascribed to a distinguished
writer. Shakespeare is full of expressions which have since, and
because of his use of them, become literally household words. Many
words that have now a general application arose out of a peculiar
local situation, myth, or name. "Boycott" which has become a reasonably
intelligible and universal word, only less than fifty years ago
referred particularly and exclusively to Boycott, a certain unpopular
Irish landowner who was subjected to the kind of discrimination for
which the word has come to stand. "Burke" used as a verb has its
origin in the name of a notorious Edinburgh murderer. Characters
in fiction or drama, history or legend come to be standard words.
Everyone knows what we mean when we speak of a Quixotic action,
a Don Juan, a Galahad, a Chesterfield. To tantalize arises from
the mythical perpetual frustration of Tantalus in the Greek story.
Expressions that had a special meaning in the works of a philosopher
or litt&eacute;rateur come to be generally used, as "Platonic love."[1]
Again words that arise as mere popular witticisms or vulgarisms may
be brought into the language as permanent acquisitions. "Mob," now
a quite <a name="page_227"><span class="page">Page 227</span></a>
legitimate word, was originally a shortening of <i>mobile vulgum</i>,
and was, only a hundred years ago, suspect in polite discourse.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Though this is very loosely and inaccurately used.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Outside the deliberate invention by scientists of terms for the new
relations they have discovered, more or less spontaneous variation
in the use of words and their unconscious assimilation by large
numbers with whose other language habits they chance to fit, is
the chief source of language growth. One might almost say words
are wrenched from their original local setting, and given such a
generalized application that they are made available for an infinite
complexity of scientific and philosophical thought.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Uniformities in language.</b> Thus far we have discussed changes
in language from the psychological viewpoint, that is, we have
considered the human tendencies and habits which bring about changes
in the articulation and meaning, in the sound and the sense, of
words. It is evident from these considerations that there can be no
absolute uniformity in spoken languages, not even in the languages
of two persons thrown much together. Within a country where the same
language is ostensibly spoken, there are nevertheless differences
in the language as spoken by different social strata, by different
localities. There are infinite subtle variations between the
articulation and the word uses of different individuals. There
are languages within languages, the dialects of localities, the
jargon of professional and trade groups, the special pronunciations
and special and overlapping vocabularies of different social classes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while there are these many causes, both of individual difference
and of differing social environments, why languages do not remain
uniform, there are similar causes making for a certain degree of
uniformity within a language. There is one very good reason why, to
a certain extent, languages do attain uniformity; they are socially
acquired. The individual learns to speak a language from those
about him, and individuals brought up within the same group will
consequently learn to <a name="page_228"><span class="page">Page
228</span></a> speak, within limits, the same tongue; they will
learn to articulate through imitation, and, while no individual
ever precisely duplicates the sounds of others, he duplicates them
as far as possible. He learns, moreover, as has already been pointed
out, to attach given meanings to given words, not for any reason of
their peculiar appositeness or individual caprice, but because he
learns that others about him habitually attach certain meanings to
certain sounds. And since one is stimulated to expression primarily
by the desire and necessity of communication of ideas a premium
is put upon uniformity. It is of no use to use a language if it
conceals one's thoughts. In consequence, within a group individual
variations, unless for reasons already discussed they happen to
lend themselves to ready assimilation by the group, will be mere
slips of the tongue. They will be discarded and forgotten, or, if
the individual cannot rid himself of them, will like stammering
or stuttering or lisping be set down as imperfections and social
handicaps. The uniformity of language within groups whose individual
members have much communication with each other is thus to a certain
extent guaranteed. A man who is utterly individualistic in his
language might just as well have no language at all, unless for
the satisfaction of expressing to himself his own emotions.[1]
Language is learned from the group among whom one moves, and those
sounds and senses of words are, on the whole, retained, which are
intelligible to the group. Those sounds and meanings will best
be understood which are already in use. No better illustration
could be found of how custom and social groups preserve and enforce
standards of individual action.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: There have been a few poets, like Emily Dickinson,
or mystics like Blake, some of whose work exhibits almost complete
unintelligibility to most readers, though doubtless it had a very
specific meaning and vividness to the writers concerned.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The obverse of the fact that intercommunication promotes uniformity
in language is that lack of communication brings about language
differentiation. The less the intercommunication between groups,
the more will the languages of the <a name="page_229"><span
class="page">Page 229</span></a> groups differ, however uniform
they may be within the groups themselves. The most important factor
in differentiation of language is local differentiation. In some
European countries every village speaks its own dialect. In passing
from one village to another the dialects may be mutually intelligible,
but by the time one has passed from the first village in the chain
to the last, one may find that the dialect of the first and last are
utterly unintelligible to each other. A real break in language, as
opposed to dialect variations, occurs where there is a considerable
barrier between groups, such as a mountain range, a river, a tribal
or political boundary. The more impenetrable the barriers between
two groups the more will the languages differ, and the less mutually
intelligible will they be.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Looking back over the history of language the student of linguistics
infers that those languages which bear striking or significant
similarities are related. Thus Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese,
and Roumanian are traceable directly back to the Latin. This does
not mean that all over the areas occupied by the speakers of these
languages Latin was originally spoken. But the Romans in their
conquests, both military and cultural, were able to make their
own language predominant. The variations which make French and
Roumanian, say, mutually unintelligible, are due to the fact that
Latin was for the natives in these conquered territories assimilated
to their own languages. So that, in the familiar example, the Latin
"homo" becomes "uomo" in Italian, "homme" in French, "hombre" in
Spanish, and "om" in Roumanian. Similarly related but mutually
unintelligible languages among the American Indians have been traced
to three great source-languages.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The history of European languages offers an interesting example of
differentiation. English and German, for example, are both traceable
back to West-Germanic; from that in turn to a hypothecated primitive
West-Germanic. All the European languages are traceable back to a
hypothecated <a name="page_230"><span class="page">Page 230</span></a>
Primitive Indo-European.[1] The theory held by most students of this
subject is that the groups possessing this single uniform language
spread over a wider and wider area, gradually became separated from
each other by geographical barriers and tribal affiliations, and
gradually (and on the part of individual speakers unconsciously)
modified their speech so that slight differences accumulated, and
resulted finally in widely different and mutually unintelligible
languages.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: By the word "primitive" the linguistic experts mean
a language the existence of which is inferred from common features
of several related languages, of which written records are current,
but of which no actual records exist. Thus, if there were no written
records of Latin the approximate reconstruction of it by linguists
would be called "Primitive Romance."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The process of differentiation in the languages of different groups
is very marked. We find, for example, in the early history of Greece
and Rome, a number of widely different dialects. There seems every
evidence that these were derived from some more primitive tongue. We
find, likewise, on the American continent, several hundred different
languages, which&mdash;to the untrained observer&mdash;bear not the
slightest resemblance to each other. This welter and confusion can
also be traced back to a few primitive and uniform languages.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus the history of civilization reveals this striking differentiation
in the language of different groups, a counter-tendency making for
a wider uniformity of particular languages. One "favored dialect"
becomes standard, predominant and exclusive. Thus out of all the
French dialects, the one that survives is the speech of Paris;
Castilian becomes standard Spanish, and in ancient Greece the language
of Athens supersedes all the other dialects. The reasons for the
survival of one out of a great welter of dialects may be various.
Not infrequently the language of a conquering people has, in more
or less pure form, succeeded the language of the conquered. This
was the case in the history of the Romance languages, which owe
their present forms to the spread of Roman arms and culture. There
was, as is well known, a <a name="page_231"><span class="page">Page
231</span></a> similar development in the case of the English language.
The Norman Conquest introduced, under the auspices of a socially
superior and victorious group, a language culturally superior to the
Anglo-Saxon. The latter was, of course, not entirely replaced, but
profoundly modified, especially in the enrichment and enlargement of
its vocabulary. One has but to note such words as "place," "choir,"
"beef," etc., which came entirely to replace in the language the
indigenous Anglo-Saxon names for those objects.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Colonization and commercial expansion may bring about the replacement
of the native language of special localities by the language of
the colonizers, at least in hybrid form. The spread of English
through Australia, and through the larger part of North America,
the spread of Spanish through South America, in each instance
practically replacing the native tongues, are cases in point.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dialects and jargons are often the result of the partial
assimilation by the speakers of one language of another language
to which they are exposed. French-Canadian and Pennsylvania Dutch
are examples of such a mixture.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Standardization of language.</b> At the present time, and for
some time in the past, the differentiation of language has been
greatly lessened by the stabilizing influence of print. The printed
word continually recalls the standard pronunciation and meaning,
and the changes in language (save those deliberately introduced
by the addition of scientific terms, or the official modifications
of spelling, etc., as in some European countries[2]) are much less
rapid, various, and significant than hitherto. It is true that
differences in articulation and usage, especially the former, do
still, to a degree, persist and develop. Our Southern accent, with
its drawling of words and slurring of consonants, our Middle-Western
accent, with its stressed articulation of "r's" and its nasalizing
tendencies, are instances of this persistence.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: In France the Ministry of Education from time to time
settles points of orthography definitely.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the printed language&mdash;English, for example&mdash;the official
language, which is published in the newspapers, periodicals, <a
name="page_232"><span class="page">Page 232</span></a> and books,
which is taught in the schools, and spoken from the pulpit, the
platform, on the stage, in cultivated society, is more or less
alike all over the United States and wherever English is spoken.
It is, of course, only a standard, a norm, an ideal, which like the
concept of the circle, never quite appears in practice. The language
which is spoken, even in the conversation of the educated, by no
means conforms to the ideal of "correct usage." But the important
fact is that the standard language <i>is</i> a standard, that it
is, moreover, a widely recognized and effective standard. The
dictionaries and the grammars become authoritative, and are referred
to when people consciously set about discovering what <i>is</i> the
accepted or correct meaning or pronunciation. But a more effectual
authority is exerted by the teaching they receive at school, and
the continuous, though unnoticed, influence of the more or less
standard language which they read in print.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even phonetic changes, though they persist, are checked from spreading
to the point of mutually unintelligible dialects by the standards
enforced in print. The "accents" in various parts of the United States,
for example, differ, but not to the point of becoming absolutely
divergent languages. The Southerner and the Westerner may be conscious
in each other's speech of a quaint and curious difference in
pronunciation, but they can, except in extreme cases, completely
understand each other.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Some of the isolated districts in the Kentucky mountains
reveal dialects with some important differences in vocabulary and
construction. These are shown most strikingly in some of the ballads
of that region which have been collected by William Aspinwall Bradley,
and by Howard Brockway. Rural schools and the breakdown of complete
isolation will probably in time eliminate this divergence.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The most important stabilizing influence of print, however, is
its fixation of meanings. It makes possible their maintenance
uncorrupted and unmodified over wide stretches in which there are
phonetic variations. These variant articulations in different parts
of a large country where the same language is spoken, would, if
unchecked, eventually modify the <a name="page_233"><span
class="page">Page 233</span></a> sense of words. Print largely
prevents this from happening. One can read newspapers published
in Maine, California, Virginia, and Iowa, without noticing any
significant, or, in many cases, even slight differences in vocabulary
or construction. There are, of course, local idioms, but these
persist in conversation, rather than in print, save where they
are caught up and exploited for literary purposes by a Bret Harte,
a Mark Twain, or an O. Henry.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Counter-tendencies toward differentiation.</b> While the
<i>standard</i> language does become fixed and stable, there are, in
the daily life of different social groups, varying actual languages.
Every class, or profession, every social group, whether of interest,
or occupation, has its slight individuality in articulation or
vocabulary. We still observe that members of a family talk alike;
sometimes households have literally their own household words.
And on different economic and social levels, in different sports,
intellectual, professional, and business pursuits, we notice slightly
different "actual" languages. These partly overlap. The society
lady, the business man, the musician, the professor of literature,
the mechanic, have specializations of vocabulary and construction,
but there is, for each of them, a great common linguistic area.
Every individual's speech is a resultant of the various groups
with whom he associates. He is affected in his speech habits most
predominantly, of course, by his most regular associates, professional
and social. In consequence we still mark out a man, as much as
anything, by the kind of language he speaks. The mechanic and the
man of letters are not likely to be mistaken for each other, if
overheard in a street car. Many literary and dramatic characters
are memorable for their speech habits. Such types are successful
when they do hit upon really significant linguistic peculiarities.
Their frequent failures lie in making the language of a particular
social type artificially stable. No one ever talks quite as the
conventional stage policeman, stage professor, and stage Englishman
talk.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_234"><span class="page">Page 234</span></a> These
actual variations in the language, as it is used by various groups
who are brought up under the same standard language, operate to
prevent complete stabilization of language. Such variations are
remarkably influential, considering the conservative influences
upon language of the repeated and continuous suggestion made by the
printed page. The language is, in the first place, being continually
enriched through increments of new words and modifications of old ones,
from the special vocabularies of trades, professions, sciences, and
sports. Through some accidental appositeness to some contemporaneous
situation, these may become generally current. A recent and familiar
example is the term "camouflage," which from its technical sense
of protective coloration has become a universally understood name
for moral and intellectual pretense. The vocabulary of baseball
has by this time already given to the language words that show
promise of attaining eventual legitimacy. An increasingly large
source of enrichment of the native tongue comes from the "spontaneous
generation" of slang, which, starting in the linguistic whimsicality
of one individual, gets caught up in conversation, and finds its
ultimate way into the language. Important instruments, certainly
in the United States, in spreading such neologisms are the humorous
and sporting pages of the newspapers, in which places they not
infrequently originate.[1] Whether a current slang expression will
persist, or perish (as do thousands initiated every year), <a
name="page_235"><span class="page">Page 235</span></a> depends on
accidents of contemporary circumstances. If the expression happens to
set off aptly a contemporary situation, it may become very widespread
until that situation, such as a political campaign, is over. But it
may, like the metaphor of a poet, have some universal application.
"Log-rolling," "graft," "bluff," have come into the language to
stay. Roosevelt's "pussy-foot," and "Ananias Club" are, perhaps,
remembered, but show less promise of permanency. "Movies" has already
ceased to be a neologism, its ready adoption illustrating a point
already mentioned, namely, that a variation that facilitates speech
(as "movies" does in comparison with "moving pictures," or "motion
pictures ") has a high potentiality of acceptance.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: H. L. Mencken in his suggestive book, <i>The American
Language</i>, sees in this upshoot of phrases indigenous to the
soil and the temper of the American people, and of grammatical
constructions also, symptoms of the increasing divergence of the
American from the English language. That there are a large number
of special expressions exclusively used in the United States, and
parts of the United States, that are not found in use in England,
goes without saying. Everyone knows that the Englishman says "lift"
where we say "elevator," "shop," where we are likely to say "store."
There are significant differences to be found even in the casual
expressions of American and English newspapers. But it is doubtful
whether the divergence can go very far, in view of the constant
intercommunication, the rapidity of travel between the two countries,
and the promiscuous reading of English books in America, and American
books in England.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Language as emotional and logical.</b> Since language is primarily
useful as an instrument of communication, it should ideally be a
direct and clean-cut representation of experience. It should be as
unambiguous, and immediate, as telegraphy, algebra, or shorthand.
But language has two functions, which interfere with one another.
Words not only represent logical relations; they provoke emotional
responses. They not only explicitly tell; they implicitly suggest.
They are not merely skeletons of thought; they are clothed with
emotional values. They are not, in consequence, transitive vehicles
of thought. Words should, from the standpoint of communication,
be mere signals to action, which should attract attention only
in so far as they are signals. They should be no more regarded
as things in themselves than is the green lamp which signals a
locomotive engineer to go ahead. They should be as immediate signals
to action as, at a race, the "Ready, set, go" of the starter is
to the runner. Yet this rarely happens in the case of words. They
frequently impede or mislead action by arousing emotions irrelevant
to their intellectual significance, or provoke action on the basis
of emotional associations rather than on their merits, so to speak,
as logical representations of ideas.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To take an example: England, as an intellectual symbol, <a
name="page_236"><span class="page">Page 236</span></a> may be said
to be a name given to a small island bounded by certain latitudes
and longitudes, having a certain distribution of raw materials
and human beings, and a certain topography. It might just as well
be represented by X for all practical purposes. Thus in the secret
code of the diplomatic corps if X were agreed on as the symbol for
England, it would be just as adequate and would even save time. But
England (that particular sound) for a large number of individuals
who have been brought up there, has become the center of deep and
far-reaching emotional associations, so that its utterance in the
presence of a particular listener may do much more than represent
a given geographical fact. It may be associated with all that he
loves, and all that he remembers with affection; it may suggest
landscapes that are dear to him, a familiar street and house, a
particular set of friends, and a cherished historical tradition
of heroic names and storied places. It may arouse such ardor and
devotion as Henley expresses in his famous <i>England, my England</i>:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"What have I done for you,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; England, my England,<br />
&nbsp; What is there I would not do,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; England, my own?<br />
&nbsp; With your glorious eyes austere,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the Lord were walking near,<br />
&nbsp; Whispering terrible things and dear,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the song on your bugles blown,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; England&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Round the world on your bugles blown!"
</p>

<p class="indent">
Words thus become powerful provocatives of emotion. They become
loaded with all the energies that are aroused by the love, the
hate, the anger, the pugnacity, the sympathy, for the persons,
objects, ideas, associated with them. People may be set off to
action by words (just as a bull is set off by a red rag), although
the words may be as little freighted with meaning as they are deeply
weighted with emotion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Poets and literary men in general exploit these emotional values that
cling to words. Indeed, in epithets suggesting <a name="page_237"><span
class="page">Page 237</span></a> illimitable vistas, inexpressible
sorrows, and dim-remembered joys, lies half the charm of poetry.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Before the beginning of years,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came to the making of man,<br />
&nbsp; Time with a gift of tears,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grief with a glass that ran;<br />
&nbsp; Pleasure with pain for a leaven,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summer with flowers that fell;<br />
&nbsp; Remembrance fallen from Heaven,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And madness risen from Hell,<br />
&nbsp; Strength without hands to smite,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love that endures for a breath,<br />
&nbsp; Night the shadow of light,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And life, the shadow of death."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Swinburne: <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i> (David Mackay
edition), p. 393.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Swinburne does not, to be sure, give us much information, and what
there is is mythical, but he uses words that are fairly alive with
suggested feeling.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But this emotional aura in which words are haloed, beautiful though
it is in literature, and facile though it makes the communication
of common feelings, is a serious impediment in the use of words as
effective instruments of communication. Language oscillates, to
speak metaphorically, between algebra and music. To be useful as
an instrument of thought it should keep to the prosaic terseness
of a telegraphic code. One should be able to pass immediately from
the word to the thing, instead of dissolving in emotions at the
associations that the mere sound or music of the epithet arouses.
Words should, so to speak, tend to business, which, in their case, is
the communication of ideas. But words are used in human situations.
And they accumulate during the lifetime of the individual a great
mass of psychological values. Thus, to take another illustration,
"brother" is a symbol of a certain relationship one person bears
to another. "Your" is also a symbolic statement of a relation.
But if a telegram contains the statement "Your brother is dead,"
it is less a piece of information to act on than a deep emotional
stimulus to which one responds. Bacon long ago pointed out how
men "worshipped <a name="page_238"><span class="page">Page
238</span></a> words." As we shall see presently, he was thinking
of errors in the intellectual manipulation of words. Perhaps as
serious is the inveterate tendency of men to respond to the more
or less irrelevant emotions suggested by a word, instead of to
its strict intellectual content. If the emotions stirred up by
an epithet were always appropriate to the word's significance,
this might be an advantage. But not infrequently, as we shall see
immediately, words suggest and may be used to suggest emotions
that, like "the flowers that bloom in the spring," have nothing
to do with the case.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In practice, political and social leaders, and all who have to
win the loyalties and support of masses of men have appreciated
the use&mdash;and misuse&mdash;that might be made of the emotional
fringes of words. Words are not always used as direct and transparent
representations of ideas; they are as frequently used as stimuli
to action. A familiar instance is seen in the use of words in
advertisements. Even the honest advertiser is less interested in
giving an analysis of his product that will win him the rational
estimation and favor of the reader than in creating in the reader
through the skillful use of words, emotions and sympathies favorable
to his product. The name of a talcum powder or tobacco is the subject
of mature consideration by the advertising expert, because he knows
that the emotional flavor of a word is more important in securing
action than its rational significance.[1] "Ask Dad! He knows!" does
not tell us much about the article it advertises, but it gives us
the sense of secure trust that we had as a boy in those mysterious
things in an almost completely unknown world which our fathers
knew and approved.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: It has been pointed out that such an expression as
"cellar door," considered merely from the viewpoint of sound, is one
of the most romantically suggestive words in the English language.
A consideration of some of the names of biscuits and collars will
show a similar exploitation of both the euphony and the emotional
fringes of words.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On a larger scale, in political and social affairs words are powerful
provocatives of emotion and of actions, determining to no small degree
the allegiances and loyalties of men and <a name="page_239"><span
class="page">Page 239</span></a> the satisfaction and dissatisfactions
which they experience in causes and leaders. A word remains the
nucleus of all the associations that have gathered round it in
the course of an individual's experience, though the object for
which it stands may have utterly changed or vanished. This is
illustrated in the history of political parties, whose personnel
and principles change from decade to decade, but whose names remain
stable entities that continue to secure unfaltering respect and
loyalty. In the same way, the name of country has emotional
reverberations for one who has been brought up in its traditions.
Men trust old words to which they have become accustomed just as
they trust old friends. To borrow an illustration from Graham Wallas,
for many who call themselves Socialists, Socialism is something
more than
</p>

<p class="include">
a movement towards greater social equality, depending for its force
upon three main factors, the growing political power of the working
classes, the growing social sympathy of many members of all classes,
and the belief, based on the growing authority of scientific method,
that social arrangements can be transformed by means of conscious
and deliberate contrivance.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Wallas: <i>Human Nature in Politics.</i> p. 92.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Rather
</p>

<p class="include">
the need for something for which one may love and work has created
for thousands of workingmen a personified Socialism: Socialism, a
winged goddess with stern eyes and a drawn sword, to be the hope
of the world, and the protector of those that suffer.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 93.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Political leaders and advertising experts, no less than poets, have
recognized the importance of the suggestive power of words. Half
the power of propaganda lies in its arousing of emotions through
suggestion, rather than in its effectiveness as an instrument of
intellectual conversion.[3]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: During the recent Liberty Loan campaigns, for example,
when it was of the most crucial practical importance that bonds be
bought, the stimuli used were not in the form of reasoned briefs,
but rather emotional admonition: "Finish the lob," "Every miser
helps the Kaiser," "If you were out in No Man's Land."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Language and logic.</b> Even where words are freed from <a
name="page_240"><span class="page">Page 240</span></a> irrelevant
emotional associations, they are still far from being adequate
instruments of thought. To be effectively representative, words
must be clean-cut and definitive; they must stand for one object,
quality, or idea. Words, if they are to be genuine instruments
of communication, must convey the same intent or meaning to the
listener as they do to the speaker. If the significance attached
to words is so vague and pulpy that they mean different things to
different men, they are no more useful in inquiry and communication
than the shock of random noise or the vague stir and flutter of music.
Words must have their boundaries fixed, they must be terms, fixed
and stable meanings, or they will remain instruments of confusion
rather than communication. Francis Bacon stated succinctly the
dangers involved in the use of words:
</p>

<p class="include">
For men imagine that their reason governs words, whilst in fact
words react upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy
and the sciences sophistical and inactive. Words are generally formed
in a popular sense, and define things by those broad lines which are
most obvious to the vulgar mind; but when a more acute understanding
or more diligent observation is anxious to vary these lines, and
adapt them more accurately to nature, words oppose it. Hence the
great and solemn disputes of learned men terminate frequently in
mere disputes about words and names, in regard to which it would
be better to proceed more advisedly in the first instance, and
to bring such disputes to a regular issue by definitions. Such
definitions, however, cannot remedy the evil ... for they consist
themselves of words, and these words produce others....
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: <i>Novum Organum</i>. bk. I, aphorism 59.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
If, to take an extreme case, a speaker said the word "chair," and
by "chair" his listener understood what we commonly mean by the
word "table," communication would be impossible. There must be some
common agreement in the words used. In the case of simple terms
referring to concrete objects there are continual concrete reminders
of the meaning of a word. We do not make mistakes as to the meaning
of words such as chair, river, stone, stove, books, forks, knives,
<a name="page_241"><span class="page">Page 241</span></a> because
we so continually meet and use them. We are continually checked
up, and the meanings we attach to these cannot go far astray.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the further terms are removed from physical objects, the more
opportunity is there for ambiguity. In the realm of politics and
morals, as Socrates was fond of pointing out, the chief difficulties
and misunderstandings of men have come from the ambiguities of the
terms they use. "Justice," "liberty," "democracy," "good," "true,"
"beautiful," these have been immemorial bones of contention among
philosophers. They are accepted, taken for granted, without any
question as to their meaning by the individual, until he finds,
perhaps, in discussion that his acceptation of the term is entirely
different from that of his opponent. Thus many an argument ends
with "if that's what you mean, I agree with you." Intellectual
inquiry and discussion to be fruitful must have certain definitive
terms to start with.
</p>

<p class="include">
Discussion ... needs to have the ground or basis of its various
component statements brought to consciousness in such a way as to
define the exact value of each. The Socratic contention is the need
compelling the common denominator, the common subject, underlying
the diversity of views to exhibit itself. It alone gives a sure
standard by which the claims of all assertions may be measured.
Until this need is met, discussion is a self-deceiving play with
unjudged, unexamined matters, which, confused and shifting, impose
themselves upon us.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>Essays in Experimental Logic</i>, p. 200.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To define our terms means literally to know <i>what</i> we are
talking about and what others are talking about. One of the values
of discussion is that it enables us more clearly to realize the
meaning of the words with which we constantly operate. A man may
entertain for a long while a half-conscious definition of democracy
as meaning political equality, and suddenly come face to face with
another who means by it industrial co&ouml;peration and participation
on the part of all workers. Whether he agrees with the new definition
or not, at least his own becomes clearer by contrast.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_242"><span class="page">Page 242</span></a> "Science,"
wrote Condillac, "is a well-made language." No small part of the
technique of science lies in its clear definition of its terms.
The chemist knows what he means by an "acid," the biologist by
a "mammal." Under these names he classifies all objects having
certain determinable properties. Social science will never attain
the precision of the physical sciences until it also attains as
clear and unambiguous a terminology. As we shall see in the chapter
on science, however, the definitions in the physical sciences are
arrived at through precise inquiries not yet possible in the field
of social phenomena.

CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">RACIAL AND CULTURAL CONTINUITY</p>

<p class="indent">
That the history of the race is an unbroken continuum goes without
saying. What this means in the way of transmission of the arts, the
sciences, the religion, the ideas, the customs of one generation
to the next, we shall presently see. Cultural continuity is made
possible by the more fundamental fact of the actual biological
continuity of the race. This biological continuity extends back,
as far as we can infer from the scientific evidence, unbrokenly
through the half million years since man has left traces of his
presence on earth. The continuity of life itself goes back to that
still more remote time when man and ape were indistinguishable,
indeed to that postulated epoch when life as it existed on earth
was no more complex than it is as it now appears in the one-celled
animal. Evolution has taught us that life, however it started, has
been one long continuous process which has increased in complexity
from the unicellular animals to man.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The continuity of the human race is a contrivance of nature rather
than of man. It is, as it were, a by-product of the sex instinct.
Man is endowed natively with a powerful desire for sex gratification,
and though offspring are the chief utility of this instinct, desire
for reproduction is not normally its primary stimulus. But while
the production of offspring may thus be said to be an incidental
result of the sex instinct, human reproduction may be subjected
to rational consideration and control, according as offspring are
or are not considered desirable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sense of the desirability of offspring may, in the first place,
be determined by social rather than individual considerations. To
the group or the state a large birth-rate, a steady increase of
the number of births over the number of <a name="page_244"><span
class="page">Page 244</span></a> deaths, may be made desirable
by the need of a large population for agriculture, herding, or
war. In primitive tribes, superiority in numbers must have been,
under conditions of competitive warfare, a pronounced asset. In
any imperialistic r&eacute;gime, where military conquest is highly
regarded, the maintenance and replenishment of large armies is a
factor that has entered into reflection on the question of population.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In cases where a small ruling class is benefited by the labor of a
slave or serf class, there is, at least for the ruling classes, a
marked utility in the increase in population. It means just so much
opportunity for increase of wealth on the part of landowning and
slaveholding or serf-controlling classes. In any country, increase
in the labor supply means just so much more human energy for the
control of natural resources, so many more units of energy for
the production of national wealth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Offspring may come to be reflectively desired by the individual
as a means of perpetuating property, family, or fame. A man cannot
nonchalantly face the prospect of obliteration, and the biological
fact of death may be circumvented by the equally real fact of
reproduction. A man's individuality, we have already had occasion
to see, is enhanced by his possessions, and if his fortune or estate
is handed down he shall not altogether have been obliterated from
the earth. Similarly, where a family has become a great tradition,
there may be a deliberate desire on the part of an individual to
have the name and tradition carried on, to keep the old lineage
current and conspicuous among men. A man may think through his
children to keep his own fame alive in posterity. At least his
name shall be known, and if, as so often happens, a son follows in
his father's profession, carries on his father's business, farm,
or philanthropies, the individual attains at least some measure
of vicarious immortality. His own ways, habits, traditions are
carried on.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A man may, moreover, come to desire offspring for the pleasures and
responsibilities of domesticity and parenthood. <a name="page_245"><span
class="page">Page 245</span></a> There is a parental instinct as
such, certainly very strong in most women, and not lacking to some
degree in most men. The joys of caring for and rearing a child have
too often been celebrated in literature and in life by parents
both young and old to need more explicit statement here.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Restriction of population.</b> But reproduction has been in
human history promiscuous, and increase of population has been less
a problem to moralists and economists than has its restriction.
The danger of over-increase in population was first powerfully stated
by Malthus in his <i>Essay on Population</i>. Malthus contended in
effect that population always tends to increase up to the limit
of subsistence, and gives indications, unless increase is checked,
of increasing beyond it. In its extreme form, as it appeared in
Malthus's first edition of his <i>Essay</i>, it ran somewhat as
follows:
</p>

<p class="include">
As things are now, there is a perpetual pressure by population on
the sources of food. Vice and misery cut down the number of men
when they grow beyond the food. The increase of men is rapid and
easy; the increase of food is in comparison, slow, and toilsome.
They are to each other as a geometrical increase to an arithmetical;
in North America, the population double their number in twenty
years.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bonar: <i>Philosophy and Political Economy in their
Historic Relations</i>, p. 205.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Malthus's pessimistic prophecy of the increase of population beyond
the means of subsistence has been subjected to refutation by various
causes. For one thing, among civilized races at least, the birth-rate
is declining. Again, intensive agriculture has vastly increased
the possibilities of our natural resources. On this point, writes
Kropotkin, who is better acquainted with agricultural conditions
than are most social reformers:
</p>

<p class="include">
They [market gardeners] have created a totally new agriculture.
They smile when we boast about the rotation system having permitted
us to take from the field one crop every year, or four crops each
three years, because their ambition is to have six and nine crape
from the very same plot of land during the twelve months. They do
not understand our talk about good and bad soils, because they
make the soils themselves, and make it in such quantities as to be
<a name="page_246"><span class="page">Page 246</span></a> compelled
yearly to seed some of it; otherwise it would raise up the levels
of their gardens by half an inch, every year. They aim at cropping,
not five or six tons of grass on the acre as we do, but from fifty
to one hundred tons of various vegetables on the same space; not
51 pounds worth of hay, but 100 pounds worth of vegetables of the
plainest description, cabbages and carrots.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Kropotkin: <i>Fields, Factories, and Workshops</i>,
p. 74.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of intensive industry the same might be said. Where formerly a
man could produce only enough for one man's consumption, under
conditions of machine production one man's work can supply quantities
sufficient for many. With a declining birth-rate and the vastly
increased productivity of industry and agriculture, there is a
greatly reduced danger of the population growing beyond their possible
sustenance by the available food supply.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Under certain economic and social conditions there are marked variations
in the birth-rate. This may be due to various causes which are,
by different writers, variously assigned. The variation of the
birth-rate among different classes is again a matter of common
observation and statistical certainty. Higher standards of living
are found regularly to be correlated with a decrease in the number
of children in a family. An important factor in the voluntary
restriction of population is the desire to give children that are
brought into the world adequate education, environment, and social
opportunity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Cultural continuity.</b> To the very young the world seems an
unprecedented novelty. It seems scarcely older than their own memories,
which are few and short, and their own experience, which is necessarily
limited and confined. Through education our experience becomes
immeasurably widened; we can vicariously live through the experiences
of other people through hearing or reading, and can acquire the
racial memory which goes back as far as the records of history,
or anthropological research. As we grow older we come to learn
that our civilization has a history; that our present has a past.
<a name="page_247"><span class="page">Page 247</span></a> This past
extends back through the countless &aelig;ons before man walked
upright. The past of human life on earth goes back itself over
nearly half a million years. With this long past, the present is
continuous, being as it were, additional pages in process of being
written.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The physical continuity of the race is insured, as we have just
seen, by a mechanism, which, though it may be subjected to rational
consideration, is instinctive in its operation. The human beings that
people the earth to-day are offspring of human ancestors reaching
back to the appearance of the human animal in the long process of
the evolution of life on earth. So far as we can see, posterity
will be for countless generations physically similar to ourselves,
as they certainly will, unless all records or evidences of the
fact are obscured, trace their ancestry continuously back to us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not only is there continuity of physical descent, however, but
continuity of cultural achievement. The past, in any literal temporal
sense, is over and done with. The Romans are physically dead, as
are the generations of barbarians of the Dark Ages, and all the
inhabitants of medi&aelig;val and modern Europe, save our own
contemporaries. Yesterdays are irrevocably over. The past, in any
real sense, exists only in the form of achievements that have been
handed down to us from previous generations. The only parts of the
past that survive physically are the actual material products and
achievements of bygone generations, the temples and the cathedrals,
the sculptures and the manuscripts, the roads and the relics of
earlier civilizations. Even these exist in the present; they are
evidences, memorials, mementos of the past. These heritages from
past civilizations may be interesting, intrinsically, as in the
case of paintings and statues, or useful, as in the case of roads,
reservoirs, or harbors.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But we inherit the past in a more vital sense. We inherit ways
of thought and action, social systems, scientific and industrial
methods, manners and morals, educational bequests and ideals, all
that we have and are. Without these, each <a name="page_248"><span
class="page">Page 248</span></a> generation would have to start
anew. If the whole of existing society were destroyed, and a newborn
generation could be miraculously preserved to maturity, its members
would have to start on the same level, with the same ignorances,
uncertainties, and impotences as primitive savages.
</p>

<p class="include">
In order to make the nature and variety of our abject dependence
on the past clear, we have only to consider our language, our laws,
our political and social institutions, our knowledge and education,
our view of this world and the next, our tastes and the means of
gratifying them. On every hand the past dominates and controls
us, for the most part unconsciously and without protest on our
part. We are in the main its willing adherents. The imagination
of the most radically-minded cannot transcend any great part of
the ideas and customs transmitted to him. When once we grasp this
truth, we shall, according to our mood, humbly congratulate ourselves
that ... we are permitted to stand on the giant's shoulders, and
enjoy an outlook that would be quite hidden to us, if we had to
trust to our own short legs; or we may resentfully chafe at our
bonds and, like Prometheus, vainly strive to wrest ourselves from the
rock of the past, in our eagerness to bring relief to the suffering
children of men.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In any case, whether we bless or curse the past, we are inevitably
its offspring, and it makes us its own long before we realize it.
It is, indeed, almost all that we can have.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Robinson: <i>The New History</i>, pp. 256-57.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The cultural achievements of the past, which we inherit chiefly
as social habits, are obviously not transmitted to us physically,
as are the original human traits with which this volume has so
far been chiefly concerned. They are not in our blood; they are
acquired like other habits, through contact with others and through
repeated practice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are thus to a very large extent conditioned by the past. It is as
if we had inherited a fortune composed of various kinds of properties,
houses, books, automobiles, warehouses, musical instruments, and in
addition, trade concessions, business secrets, formul&aelig;s, methods,
and good-will. Our activities will be limited in measure by the extent
of the property, its constituent items, and the repair in which we
keep it. We may squander or misinvest our principal, as when we use
scientific <a name="page_249"><span class="page">Page 249</span></a>
knowledge for dangerous or dubious aims, for example, for conquest
or rapine. We may add to it, as in the development of the sciences
and industrial arts. We may, so to speak, live on the income. Such
is the case when a society ceases to be progressive, and fails to
add anything to a highly developed traditional culture, as happened
strikingly in the case of China. Again we may have inherited "white
elephants," which may be of absolutely no use to us, encumbrances of
which we cannot easily rid ourselves, influential ideas which are
no longer adequate to our present situation, obsolete emotions,
methods, or institutions. We may allow our cultural inheritance,
through bad education, to fall into disrepair and decay.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since we are so dependent on the past, our attitude toward it, which
in turn determines the use we make of it, is of the most crucial
significance. The several characteristic and varying attitudes toward
the past which are so markedly current are not determined solely by
logical considerations. For individuals and social groups particular
features of their heritage have great emotional associations. The
living past is composed of habits, traditions, values, which are
vivid and vital issues to those who practice them. Traditions,
customs, or social methods come to have intrinsic values; they
become the center of deep attachments and strong passion. They are
a rich element of the atmosphere of the present; they are woven
into the intimate fabric of our lives. The awe which we feel in
great cathedrals is historical as well as religious. Those vast
solemn arches are the voices of the past speaking to us. The moral
appeal of tradition appears with beautiful clarity in the opening
chapter of Pater's <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>.
</p>

<p class="include">
A sense of conscious powers external to ourselves, pleased or displeased
by the right or wrong conduct of every circumstance of daily
life&mdash;that <i>conscience</i>, of which the old Roman religion
was a formal, habitual recognition, had become in him a powerful
current of feeling and observance. The old-fashioned, partly Puritanic
awe, the power of which Wordsworth noted and valued so highly in a
northern <a name="page_250"><span class="page">Page 250</span></a>
peasantry, had its counterpart in the feeling of the Roman lad, as
he passed the spot, "touched of heaven," where the lightning had
struck dead an aged laborer in the field: an upright stone, still
with moldering garlands about it, marked the place. He brought to
that system of symbolic usages, and they in turn developed in him
further, a great seriousness, an impressibility to the sacredness
of time, of life and its events, and the circumstances of family
fellowship&mdash;of such gifts to men as fire, water, the earth from
labor on which they live, really understood by him as gifts&mdash;a
sense of religious responsibility in the reception of them. It was
a religion for the most part of fear, of multitudinous scruples,
of a year-long burden of forms.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Walter Pater: <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> (A. L. Burt
edition), pp. 3-4.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To the past, as it is made familiar to us through song, study, and
traditional practice, we may experience a piety amounting almost
to religious devotion. In some individuals and in some nations,
this sense for tradition is very strong.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every one has felt more or less keenly this sense of being a link
in a great tradition, whether of a college, family, or country.
Sometimes this sense for tradition takes an &aelig;sthetic form,
as in the case of ritual, whether social or religious. Old streets,
ivied towers, ancient rooms, become symbols of great and dignified
achievements; ceremonies come to be invested with a serious beauty
and memorable charm. They become reminders of a "torch to be carried
on," of a spirit to be cherished and kept alive, of a history to be
carried on or a purpose or an ideal to be fulfilled. As we shall
see in a moment, this sense for the past, which, as Santayana says,
makes a man loyal to the sources of his being, has both its virtues
and vices. It is of immense value in preserving continuity and
cultural integration, in keeping many men continuously moving toward
a single fixed end. It may also wrap dangerously irrelevant habits
and institutions in a saving&mdash;and illusive&mdash;halo.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, on the other hand, individuals with very little sense
for tradition. This may be accounted for in some cases by a marked
&aelig;sthetic insensibility, which sees in ritual, ceremony, <a
name="page_251"><span class="page">Page 251</span></a> or habit,
merely the literal, without any appreciation at all of its symbolic
significance.[1] In other cases, individuals are unsusceptible and
hostile to tradition, because they have themselves been socially
disinherited. This is illustrated not infrequently in the case
of foreigners who, for one reason or another, have left and lost
interest in their native land, and become men without a country.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: This is illustrated by the crass excesses of certain
radical satirists of religious forms. Those who are the enemies
of religion for economic, social, or intellectualistic reasons
combine a singular sense of the literal absurdities of religious
forms with a marked insensibility to their symbolic values. One
may find interesting examples, from Voltaire to Robert Ingersoll.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are others by temperament rebellious and iconoclastic, who
combine a keen sense of present difficulties and problems with small
reverence, use for, or interest in the past, and small imaginative
sympathy with it. The past is to them a "sea of errors." They regard
all past achievements as bad scribblings which must be erased, so
that we may start with a clean slate. There have been included among
such, great historical reformers. Bentham's enthusiasm for progress
led him into most intemperate attacks on history and historical
method. The most noted of the eighteenth-century philosophers saw
nothing but evil in tradition. Such sentiments were echoed in the
early nineteenth century by Shelley, Godwin, and their circle,
as expressed, for example, in Shelley's "Hellas":
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The world's great age begins anew,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The golden years return,<br />
&nbsp; The earth doth like a snake renew<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her winter weeds outworn;<br />
&nbsp; Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like wrecks of a dissolving dream.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />
"Another Athens shall arise,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to remoter time<br />
&nbsp; Bequeath, like sunset to the skies,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The splendor of its prime;<br />
&nbsp; And leave, if nought so bright can live,<br />
&nbsp; All earth can take or Heaven can give."
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is not surprising that men with an eye fixed on the future <a
name="page_252"><span class="page">Page 252</span></a> should develop
a contempt or an obliviousness of the past. Utopians nearly always
start with "a world various and beautiful and new."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Perhaps the chief ingredient in such discounting of all past history
is the rebel temperament which wants to break away from what it
regards as the chains, the dead weight, the ruts of tradition. It
cheerfully says, "Nous changerons tout cela," and does not stop
to discriminate between the <i>roads</i> and the <i>ruts</i> that
have been made by people in the past.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These two temperaments,[1] play a large part in determining attitudes
toward the past. The one regards with awe and reverence past
achievement, and rests his faith on the experiments which have
been tested and proved by time. The other, to state the position
extremely, regards each day as the possible glorious dawn of a
completely new world. The first attitude, when intemperately preached
and practiced, becomes an uncritical veneration of the past; the
second, an uncritical disparagement. We shall briefly examine each.

<b>Uncritical veneration of the past.</b> The extreme form of uncritical
veneration of the past may be said to take the position that old
things are good simply because they are <i>old</i>; new things
are evil simply because they are <i>new</i>. Institutions, Ideas,
Customs are, like wines, supposed to attain quality with age. A
custom, a law, a code of morals is defined or maintained on the
ground of its ancient&mdash;and honorable&mdash;history, of the great
span of years during which it has been current, of the generation
after generation that has lived under its auspices. The ways of
our fathers, the old time-tested ways, these, we are told, must
be our ways.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The psychological origins of this position have in part been discussed.
There is in some individuals a highly developed <a name="page_253"><span
class="page">Page 253</span></a> sentiment and reverence for tradition
as such, and an &aelig;sthetic sensibility to the mellowness, ripeness,
and charm that so often accompany old things.[1] The new seems, as
it often is, loud, brassy, vulgar, and hard. But there are other
and equally important causes. Men trust and cherish the familiar
in ideas, customs, and social organization, just as they trust and
cherish old friends. They know what to expect from them; they have
their well-noted excellences, and, while they have their defects,
these also are definitely known and can be definitely reckoned
with. The old order may not be perfect, but it is an order, and an
order whose outlines and possibilities are known and predictable.
Change means change to the unaccustomed and the unfamiliar. And the
unaccustomed and the unfamiliar, as already pointed out, normally
arouse fear. One of the conventional phrases (which has become
conventional because it is accurate) with which changes have been
greeted is the <i>clich&eacute;</i>, "we view with alarm." No small
part of genuine opposition to change comes from the cautious and
conscientious types of mind which will not sanction the reckless
taking of chances, especially where the interests of large groups
are concerned, which want to know precisely where a change will
lead. Such a mind holds off from committing society to making changes
that will put a situation beyond control and lead to unforeseen
and uncontrollable dangers. Especially is this felt by the
administrator, by the man who has experience with the difficulties
of putting ideas in practice, who knows how vastly more difficult
it is to operate with people than with paper.[2] The man of affairs
knows <a name="page_254"><span class="page">Page 254</span></a>
how easy it is to check and change ideas in one's mind, but knows
also the uncontrollable momentum of ideas when they are acted upon
by vast numbers of men.

institution, "looks just as it ought to look." And one is reminded
of the story of the American lady who, admiring the smooth lawns
at Oxford, asked a gardener how they managed to give them that
velvet gloss. "We roll them, madam," he said, "for eight hundred
years."]

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Thus writes Catharine II, in a letter to Diderot, the
French philosopher and humanitarian: "M. Diderot, in all your schemes
of reform, you entirely forget the difference in our position; you
work only on paper, which endures all things; it offers no obstacle,
either to your pen or your imagination. But I, poor Empress that
I am, work on a far more delicate and irritable substance, the
human skin."]

<p class="indent">
Again, the maintenance of ways that have been practiced in the
past has a large hold over people, for reasons already discussed
in the chapter on Habit. The old and the accustomed are comfortable
and facile; change means inconvenience and frustration of habitual
desires. This is in part the explanation of the increasing conservatism
of men as they grow older. Not only do they have a keener sense of
the difficulty of introducing changes, but their own fixed habits
of mind and emotion make part of the difficulty. They like the old
ways and persist in them just as they like and keep old books,
old friends, and old shoes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Romantic idealization of the past.</b> Reverence for the past
may also be due to a romantic idealization of it. In such cases, it
is not an interest in maintaining the present order; it is rather
a contempt for the present and wistful yearning for the "good old
days." Everyone indulges more or less in such idealization. Such
halos are made possible because we retain the pleasant rather than
the painful and dreary aspects of our past experience. The college
alumnus returning to the campus tells of the since unsurpassed
intellectual and athletic feats of the freshman class of which
he was a member. The elderly gentleman sighs over his newspaper
at the bad ways into which the world is degenerating, and yearns
for the old days when the plays were better, conversation more
interesting, houses more comfortable, and men more loyal. In similar
trivial instances we are all inclined to indulge in such mythology.
The universality and age of this tendency has been well described
by a student of Greek civilization.
</p>

<p class="include">
This is the belief of the old school of every age&mdash;there was
once a "good" time; and it matters not at all in the study of moral
ideals that no such time can be shown to have existed. The men of
the fourth century [B.C.] say that it was in the fifth; those of
the fifth <a name="page_255"><span class="page">Page 255</span></a>
say it was in the sixth; and so on infinitely. The same ideal was at
work when William Morris looked to the thirteenth century, forgetting
that Dante looked to a still earlier period; and both forgot that the
men of that earlier period said the same&mdash;"not now, indeed,
but before us men were happy." So simpler men incline to say that
their grandfathers were fine fellows, but the "old college is going
to the dogs," or "the House of Commons is not what it was once,"
for reverence and faith and manliness once ruled the world. The
old school lives upon an ignorance of history; it is genuinely
moved by a simple moral ideal of life and character which its own
imagination has created. And when evil becomes obvious, it is the
new-fangled notions that are to blame. "Trying new dodges" has
brought Athens down in the world&mdash;as Aristophanes in 393 B.C.
makes his protagonist say:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"And would it not have saved the Athenian state,<br />
&nbsp; If she kept to what was good, and did not try<br />
&nbsp; Always some new plan?"[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: C. Delisle Burns: <i>Greek Ideals</i>, pp. 118-19.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On a large scale the romantic idealization of the past has been
made into a philosophy of history. The "golden age," instead of
being put in a roseate and remote future, is put in an equally
remote and roseate past. The Greek legends were fond of a golden age
when the gods moved among men. The Garden of Eden is the Christian
apotheosis of the world's perfections. Various philosophers have
pointed out the fallacy of finding such a mythological locus for
our ideals, and evolution and the general revelations of history
have indicated the completely mythical character of the golden
age. History may, in general, be said to reveal that, whatever
the imperfections of our own age, we have immeasurably improved
in many pronounced respects over conditions earlier than our own.
The idealized picture of the Middle Ages with its guardsmen and its
courtly knights and ladies, is coming, with increasing historical
information, to seem insignificant and untrue in comparison with the
unspeakable hardships of the mass of men, the evil social and sanitary
conditions, the plagues and pestilences which were as much a part
of it. The picture of the ideally gentle and benevolent attitude
of the <a name="page_256"><span class="page">Page 256</span></a>
master to his slaves is by no means regarded as a typical picture
of conditions of slave labor in the South. We know, positively, on
the other hand, that our medicine and surgery, our scientific and
industrial methods, our production and our resources are incomparably
greater than those of any earlier period in history, as are the
possibilities of the control of Nature still unrealized.

<p class="include">
If there were time I might try to show that progress in knowledge
and its application to the alleviation of man's estate is more rapid
now than ever before. But this scarcely needs formal proof; it is so
obvious. A few years ago an eminent French <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>,
Bruneti&egrave;re, declared science bankrupt. This was on the eve
of the discoveries in radio-activity which have opened up great
vistas of possible human readjustments if we could but learn to
control and utilize the inexhaustible sources of power that lie in
the atom. It was on the eve of the discovery of the function of
the white blood corpuscles, which clears the way for indefinite
advance in medicine. Only a poor discouraged man of letters could
think for a moment that science was bankrupt. No one entitled to
an opinion on the subject believes that we have made more than a
beginning in penetrating the secrets of the organic and inorganic
worlds.[1]

</p>

<p class="indent">
Even in the face of these facts, reverence for the past may amount
to such religious veneration that change may come literally to
be regarded as sacrilegious. In primitive tribes the reasons for
this insistence are clear. Rites and rituals are used to secure
the favor of the gods and any departure from traditional customs
is looked upon as fraught with actual danger. But the past, as
it lives in established forms and practices, is still by many,
and in highly advanced societies, almost religiously cherished,
sustained, and perpetuated. Every college, religion, and country
has its traditional forms of life and practice, any infringement
of which is regarded with the gravest disapproval.[2] In social
life, generally, there are fixed forms for given occasions, forms
of address, greeting, conversation, and clothes, all that commonly
goes under the name of <a name="page_257"><span class="page">Page
257</span></a> the "conventions" or "proprieties." In law, as is
well known, there is developed sometimes to an almost absurd degree
a ritual of procedure. In religion, traditional values become embodied
in fixed rituals of music, processional, and prayer. In education,
especially higher education, there has developed a fairly stable
tradition in the granting of degrees, the elements of a curriculum,
the forms of examination, and the like. To certain types of mind,
fixed forms in all these fields have come to be regarded as of
intrinsic importance. Love of "good form," the classicist point of
view at its best, may develop into sheer pedantry and Pharisaism, an
insistence on the fixed form when the intent is changed or forgotten,
a regard for the letter rather than the spirit of the law. In a
large number of cases, the fixed modes of life and practice which
are our inheritance come to be regarded as symbols of eternal and
changeless values. Thus many highly intelligent men find ritual in
religion and traditional customs in education or in social life
freighted with symbolic significance, and any infringement of them
as almost sacrilegious in character.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: It has been said that a custom repeated on a college
campus two years in succession constitutes a tradition.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Change synonymous with evil.</b> Change, again, may be discouraged
by those who hold, with more or less sincerity, that no good can
come of it. Such a position may, and frequently is, maintained by
those in whom fortunate accident of birth, favored social position,
exuberant optimism, or a stanch and resilient faith, induces the
belief that the social order and social practices, education, law,
customs, economic conditions, science, art, <i>et al.</i>, are
completely satisfactory. Like Pippa, in Browning's poem, they are
satisfied that "God's in His Heaven; all's right with the world."
That there are no imperfections, in manners, politics, or morals,
in our present social order, that there are no improvements which
good-will, energy, and intelligence can effect, few will maintain
without qualification. To do so implies, when sincere, extraordinary
blindness to the facts, for example, of poverty and disease, which,
though they do not happen to touch a particular individual, are
patent and ubiquitous <a name="page_258"><span class="page">Page
258</span></a> enough. In the face of undeniable evils the position
that the ways we have inherited are completely adequate to our
contemporary problems cannot be ingenuously maintained.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The position more generally expounded by the opponents of change is
that our present modes of life give us the best possible results,
considering the limitations of nature and human nature, and that the
customs, institutions, and ideas we now have are the fruits of a
ripe, a mellow, and a time-tested wisdom, that any radical innovations
would, on the whole, put us in a worse position than that in which
we find ourselves. Persons taking this attitude discount every
suggested improvement on the ground that, even though intrinsically
good, it will bring a host of inevitable evils with it, and that,
all things considered, we had better leave well enough alone. Some
extreme exponents of this doctrine maintain, as did some of the
Hebrew prophets, that whatever evils are ours are our own fault,
that fault consisting in a lapse from the accustomed ancient ways.
To continue without abatement the established ways is the surest
road to happiness. Education, social customs, political organization,
these are sound and wholesome as they are; and modification means
interference with the works and processes of reason.

Later Hegel developed an elaborate philosophy of history in which
he tried to demonstrate that the history of the past was one long
exemplification of reason; that each event that happened was part
of the great cosmic scheme, an indispensable syllable of the Divine
Idea as it moved through history; each action part of the increasing
purpose that runs through the ages. That these contentions are, to
say the least, extreme, <a name="page_259"><span class="page">Page

position which sees nothing in the past but a long succession of
blunders, evils, and stupidities.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>"Order" <i>versus</i> change.</b> Finally, genuine opposition to
change arises from those who fear the instability which it implies.
Continuation in established ways makes for integration, discipline,
and stability. It makes possible the converging of means toward
an end, it cumulates efforts resulting in definite achievement.
In so far as we do accomplish anything of significance, we must
move along stable and determinate lines; we must be able to count
on the future.[1] It has already been pointed out that it is man's
docility to learning, his long period of infancy[2] which makes
his eventual achievements possible. But it is man's persistence
in the habits he has acquired that is in part responsible for his
progress. In individual life, the utility of persistence, and
concentration of effort upon a definite piece of work, have been
sufficiently stressed by moralists, both popular and professional.
"A rolling stone gathers no moss," is as true psychologically as it
is physically. Any outstanding accomplishment, whether in business,
scholarship, science, or literature, demands perseverance in definite
courses of action. We are inclined, and usually with reason, to suspect
the effectiveness of a man who has half a dozen professions in half
as many years. Such vacillations produce whimsical and scattered
movements; but they are fruitless in results; they literally "get
nowhere."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The uncertainty that business men feel during a
presidential campaign is an illustration.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: See <i>ante</i>, p. 10.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Just as, in the case of individuals, any significant achievements
require persistent convergence of means toward a definite end, so
is it in the case of social groups. No great business organizations
are built up through continual variations of policy. Similarly, in
the building up of a university, a government department, a state,
or a social order, consecutive and disciplined persistence in
established ways is a requisite of progress. Without such continuous
organization of efforts <a name="page_260"><span class="page">Page
260</span></a> toward fixed goals, action becomes frivolous and
fragmentary, a wind along a waste. The history of the English people
has elicited the admiration of philosophers and historians because
it has been such a gradual and deliberate movement, such a measured
and certain progress toward political and social freedom. To those
who appreciate the value of unity of action, of the assured fruits
of cumulative and consistent action along a given path, change as
such seems fraught with danger. Nor is it specific dangers they
fear so much as the loss of moral fiber, the scattering of energies,
the waste and futility that are frequently the net result of casual
driftings with every wind that blows. No one has more eloquently
expressed this view than Edmund Burke in his <i>Reflections on
the French Revolution:</i>
</p>

<p class="include">
But one of the first and most leading principles on which the
commonwealth and the laws are consecrated, is lest the temporary
possessors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have
received from their ancestors, or of what is due to their posterity,
should act as if they were the entire masters; that they should think
it among their rights to cut off the entail, or commit waste on the
inheritance, by destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric
of their society; hazarding to leave to those who come after them a
ruin instead of a habitation&mdash;and teaching these successors
as little to respect their contrivances, as they had themselves
respected the institutions of their forefathers. By this unprincipled
facility of changing the state as often, and as much, and in as
many ways, as there are floating fancies or fashions, the whole
chain and continuity of the commonwealth would be broken. No one
generation could link with the other. Men would be little better
than the flies of a summer.

To avoid, therefore, the evils of inconstancy and versatility,
ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest
prejudice, we have consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions, but with due caution;
that he should never dream of beginning its reformation by its
subversion; that he should approach to the faults of the state as to
the wounds of a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude.[1]

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_261"><span class="page">Page 261</span></a> <b>Personal
or class opposition to change.</b> Sincere fear of the possible evils
of novelty in the disorganization which it promotes, habituation to
established ways, or a sentimental and &aelig;sthetic allegiance to
them&mdash;all these are factors that determine genuine opposition
to change. But aversion to change may be generalized into a
philosophical attitude by those who have special personal or class
reasons for disliking specific changes. The hand-workers in the
early nineteenth century stoned the machinists and machines which
threw them out of employment. Every change does discommode some
class or classes of persons, and part of the opposition to specific
changes comes from those whom they would adversely affect. It is not
surprising that liquor interests should be opposed to prohibition,
that theatrical managers should have protested against a tax on the
theater, or those with great incomes against an excess profits
tax. Selfish opposition to specific changes is, indeed, frequently
veiled in the disguise of plausible reasons for opposition to change
in general. Those who fear the results to their own personal or
class interests of some of the radical social legislation of our
own day may disguise those more or less consciously realized motives
under the form of impartial philosophical opposition to social
change in general. They may find philosophical justification for
maintaining unmodified an established order which redounds to their
own advantage.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Uncritical disparagement.</b> The other extreme is represented
by the position that old things are bad because they are <i>old</i>,
and new things good because they are <i>new</i>. This is illustrated
in an extreme though trivial form by faddists of every kind. There
are people who chiefly pride themselves on being up-to-the-minute,
and exhibit an almost pathological fear of being behind the times.
This thirst for the novel is seen on various levels, from those who
wear the newest styles, and dine at the newest hotels, to those who
make a point of reading only the newest books, hearing only the newest
music, and discussing the latest theories. For such temperaments, <a
name="page_262"><span class="page">Page 262</span></a> and more or
less to most people, there is an intrinsic glamour about the word
"new." The physical qualities that are so often associated with
newness are carried over into social and intellectual matters, where
they do not so completely apply. The new is bright and unfrayed;
it has not yet suffered senility and decay. The new is smart and
striking; it catches the eye and the attention. Just as old things
are dog-eared, worn, and tattered, so are old institutions, habits,
and ideas. Just as we want the newest books and phonographs, the
latest conveniences in housing and sanitation, so we want the latest
modernities in political, social, and intellectual matters. Especially
about new ideas, there is the freshness and infinite possibility of
youth; every new idea is as yet an unbroken promise. It has not
been subjected to the frustrations, disillusions, and compromises
to which all theory is subjected in the world of action.[1] Every
new idea is an experiment, a possibility, a hope. It may be the
long-awaited miracle; it may be the prayed-for solution of all our
difficulties.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "Real life is, to most men, a long second-best, a
perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible; but the
world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations,
no barrier to the creative activity embodying in splendid edifices
the passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all great
work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even from the
pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created
an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its natural
home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can escape
from the dreary exile of the actual world." (Bertrand Russell:
<i>Mysticism and Logic</i>, pp. 60-61.)]
</p>

<p class="indent">
This susceptibility to the novel is peculiarly displayed by those
who see nothing but evil in the old. Against the outworn past with
its disillusions, its errors, its evils, and its hypocrisies, the
new shines out in glorious contrast. There are persons who combine
a very genuine sense of present evils with a resilient belief in
the possibilities of change. The classic instance of this is seen
in the Messianic idea. Even in the worst of times, the pious Jew
could count on the saving appearance of the Messiah. Every Utopian
is as sure of the salvation promised by his prize solution as he is
of the evils which it is intended to rectify. The ardent Socialist
may <a name="page_263"><span class="page">Page 263</span></a> equally
divide his energies between pointing out the evils of the capitalist
system, and the certain bliss of his Socialist republic. The past
is nothing but a festering mass of evils; industry is nothing but
slavery, religion nothing but superstition, education nothing but
dead traditional formalism, social life nothing but hypocrisy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where the past is so darkly conceived, there comes an uncritical
welcoming of anything new, anything that will take men away from
it. Nothing could be worse than the present or past; anything as
yet untried may be better. As Karl Marx told the working classes:
"The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have
a world to win."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The past is, by its ruthless critics, conceived not infrequently
as enchaining or enslaving. Particularly, the radical insists,
are men enslaved by habits of thought, feeling, and action which
are totally inadequate to our present problems and difficulties.
War-like emotions, he points out, may have been useful in an earlier
civilization, but are now a total disutility. Belief in magic may
have been an asset to primitive man in his ignorance; it is not to
modern man with his science. The institution of private property
may have had its values in building up civilization; its utility
is over. We still make stereotyped and archaic reactions where
the situation has utterly changed. The institutions, ideas, and
habits of the past are at once so compelling and so obsolete that
we must make a clear break with the past; we must start with a
clean slate. To continue, so we are told, is merely going further
and further along the wrong paths; it is like continuing with a
broken engine, or without a rudder.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Critical examination of the past.</b> That both positions just
discussed are extreme, goes without saying. The past is neither all
good nor all bad; it has achieved as well as it has erred. But it
is, in any case, all we have. Without the knowledge, the customs,
the institutions we have inherited, we should have no advantage at
all over our ancestors of ten thousand years ago. Biologically we
have not changed. The <a name="page_264"><span class="page">Page
264</span></a> past is our basic material. Each generation starts
with what it finds in the way of cultural achievement, and builds
upon that.
</p>

<p class="include">
Antiquity deserveth that reverence, that men should take a stand
thereupon, and discover what is the best way; but when the discovery
is well-taken, then to make progression. And to speak truly,
<i>antiquitas s&oelig;culi iuventus mundi</i>. These times are the ancient
times, when the world is ancient, and not those which we account
ancient <i>ordine retrogrado</i>, by a computation backwards from
ourselves.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bacon: <i>The Advancement of Learning</i>, Collected
Works, vol. I, p. 172.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The past, save what we discover in our generation, is our sole
storehouse of materials. And a very small part of our useful knowledge
in the industrial arts, in science, in social organization and
administration does come from our own generation. It is the accumulated
experience of generations of men. We can, out of this mass of materials,
select whatever is useful in clarifying the issues of the present,
whatever helps us to accomplish those purposes which we have, after
critical consideration, decided to be useful and serviceable. If,
for example, we decide to build a bridge, it is of importance that
we know all that men have in the past discovered of mechanical
relations and industrial art which will enable us to build a bridge
well. If we want to establish an educational system in some backward
portion of the world, it is useful for us to know what methods
men have used in similar situations. Whatever we decide to do,
we are so much the better off, if we know all that men before us
have learned in analogous instances.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But to use the inheritance of the past implies an analysis of present
problems, and an acceptance of the course to be pursued. The experience
of the past, the heritage of knowledge that has come down to us, is
so various and extensive that choices must be made. The historian
in writing even a comprehensive history of a country must still
make choices and omissions. Similarly, in using knowledge inherited
from the past as materials, we must have specific problems to <a
name="page_265"><span class="page">Page 265</span></a> govern our
choice. The statistician could collect innumerable statistics; he
collects only those which have a bearing on his subject. The lawyer
searches out that part of the legal tradition which is applicable to
his own case. Without some lead or clue we should lose ourselves
in the multifariousness of transmitted knowledge at our disposal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To use the past as an instrument for furthering present purposes
implies neither veneration nor disparagement of it. We neither condemn
nor praise the past as a whole; we regard specific institutions,
customs, or ideas, as adequate or inadequate, as serviceable or
disserviceable. In general, it may be said that the value of any
still extant part of the past, be it a work of art, a habit, a
tradition, has very little to do with its origin. The instinct
of eating is still useful though it has a long history. The works
of the Old Masters are not really great because they are old, nor
are the works of contemporaries either good or bad because they
are new. Man himself is to be estimated no differently, whether
he is descended from the angels or the apes.
</p>

<p class="include">
If we would appreciate our own morals and religion we are often
advised to consider primitive man and his institutions. If we would
evaluate marriage or property, we are often directed to study our
remote ancestors.... Such considerations as these have diverse
effects according to our temperaments. They quite uniformly produce,
however, disillusionment and sophistication.... This exaltation of
the past, as the ancestral home of all that we are, may make us
regret our loss of illusions and our disconcerting enlightenment....
We may break with the past, scorn an inheritance so redolent of
blood and lust and superstition, revel in an emancipation unguided
by the discipline of centuries, strive to create a new world every
day, and imagine that, at last, we have begun to make progress.[1]

name="page_266"><span class="page">Page 266</span></a> may have
served the purposes of a bygone generation; it does not follow
that it thereby serves our own. The reverse may similarly be true.
For us the specific features of our social inheritance depend upon
the ends or purposes which we reflectively decide upon and accept.
Whether capital punishment is good or evil; whether private property
is an adequate or inadequate institution for social welfare; whether
marriage is a perfect or an imperfect institution; whether collective
bargaining, competitive industry, old age insurance, income taxes,
nationalization of railroads are useful or pernicious depends neither
on their age nor their novelty. Their value is determined by their
relevancy to our own ideals, by the extent to which they hinder
or promote the results which we consciously desire.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The past may be studied with a view to clarifying present issues.
In the first place, we may study past successes and failures in
order to guide our actions in present similar situations. A man
setting out to organize and administer a newspaper will benefit by
the experiences others have had in the same situation. In the same
way, we can learn from past history something, at least, bearing on
present political and social issues. It is true enough that history
has been much misused for the drawing of lessons and guidance. As
Professor Robinson says:
</p>

<p class="include">
To-day, however, one rarely finds a historical student who would
venture to recommend statesmen, warriors, and moralists to place
any confidence whatsoever in historical analogies and warnings,
for the supposed analogies usually prove illusive on inspection,
and the warnings impertinent. Whether or no Napoleon was ever able
in his own campaigns to make any practical use of the accounts
he had read of those of Alexander and C&aelig;sar, it is quite
certain that Admiral Togo would have derived no useful hints from
Nelson's tactics at Alexandria or Trafalgar. Our situation is so
novel that it would seem as if political and military precedents
of even a century ago could have no possible value. As for our
present "anxious morality," as Maeterlinck calls it, it seems equally
clear that the sinful extravagances of Sardanapalus and Nero, and
the conspicuous public virtue of Aristides and the Horatii, are
alike impotent to promote it.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Robinson: <i>The New History</i>, p. 36.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_267"><span class="page">Page 267</span></a> But situations
are, within limits, duplicated in historical processes, and it is
illuminating at least to see wherein men failed and wherein they
succeeded in the things they set themselves to do. The history
of labor legislation certainly testifies to the effectiveness of
"collective bargaining" in securing improved labor conditions, as
the history of strikes does also to the public loss and injury
incident to this kind of industrial warfare. If compulsory arbitration
has been a successful method of dealing with labor difficulties in
Australia in the past, we can, by a careful study and comparison
of conditions there and conditions current in our country at the
present, illuminate and clarify our own problems. A campaign manager
in one presidential campaign does not forget what was effective
in the last, nor does he hesitate to profit by his mistakes or
those of others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An impartial survey of the heritage of the past undertakes critically
to examine institutions, customs, ideas still current with a view to
determining their relevancy and utility to our present needs. This
demands, on the one hand, clarity as to what those needs are, and, on
the other hand, freedom from prejudice for or against existing modes
of life simply because they have a history. A critical examination
of the past amounts practically to a taking stock, a summary of
our social assets and liabilities. We shall find our ideas, for
example, and our customs, a strange mixture of useful preservations,
and absurd or positively harmful relics of the past. Ideas which
were natural and useful enough in the situation in which they
originated, live on into a totally changed situation, along with
other ideas, like that of gravitation, which are as true and as
useful now as when they were first enunciated. Many customs and
institutions which may be found to have as great utility now as
when they were first practiced generations ago, the customs and
institutions, let us say, of family life, may be found persisting
along with customs and institutions, like excess legal formalism
(or, as their opponents claim, a bi-cameral legislative system or a
two-party system) which <a name="page_268"><span class="page">Page
268</span></a> may come generally to be regarded as impediments to
progress.[1] The unprejudiced observer, scientifically interested
in preserving those forms and mechanisms of social life which are of
genuine service to his own generation, will not condemn or applaud
"the past" <i>en masse</i>. He will, rather, examine it in specific
detail. He will not, for example, dismiss classical education,
because it is classical or old. He will rather try experimentally
to determine the actual consequences in the case of those who study
the classics. He will examine the claims made for the study, try in
specific cases to find out whether those claims are fulfilled, and
condemn or approve the study, say, of Latin and Greek, according
to his estimate of the desirability or undesirability of those
consequences. If he finds, for example, that the study of Latin
does promote general literary appreciation, his decision that it
should or should not be continued will depend on his opinion of
the value of general literary appreciation as compared with other
values in an industrial civilization. Similarly, with "freedom of
contract," "freedom of the seas," military service, bi-cameral
systems, party caucuses, presidential veto, and all the other political
and social heritages of the past.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The situation in the case of outworn social institutions
is paralleled in the case of the human appendix, once possessing a
function in the digestive system of primitive man, but now useless
and likely on occasion to become a positive disutility.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
But a man who impartially examines the past will usually exhibit
also an appreciation of its attainments and a sense of the present
good to which it has been instrumental. He will not glibly dismiss
institutions, habits, methods of life that are the slow accumulations
of centuries. He will have a sense of the continuous efforts and
energies that have gone into the making of contemporary civilization.
He will have, in suggesting ruthless innovations, a sobering sense
of the gradual evolution that has made present institutions, habits,
ideas, what they are.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The student of the past knows, moreover, that the present without its
background of history is literally meaningless. <a name="page_269"><span
class="page">Page 269</span></a> In the words of a well-known student
of the development of human culture:
</p>

<p class="include">
Progress, degradation, survival, modification, are all modes of the
connection that binds together the complex network of civilization.
It needs but a glance into the trivial details of our own daily
life to set us thinking how far we are really its originators,
and how far but the transmitters and modifiers of the results of
long past ages. Looking round the rooms we live in, we may try here
how far he who knows only his own time can be capable of rightly
comprehending even that. Here is the honeysuckle of Assyria, there the
fleur-de-lis of Anjou, a cornice with a Greek border runs round the
ceiling, the style of Louis XIV and its parent the Renaissance share
the looking glass between them. Transformed, shifted or mutilated,
such elements of art still carry their history plainly stamped upon
them.... It is thus even with the fashion of the clothes men wear.
The ridiculous little tails of the German postilion's coat show of
themselves how they came to dwindle to such absurd rudiments; but
the English clergyman's bands no longer so convey their history
to the eye, and look unaccountable enough till one has seen the
intermediate stages through which they came down from the more
serviceable wide collars, such as Milton wears in his portrait,
and which gave their name to the "band-box" they used to be kept
in. In fact, the books of costume showing how one garment grew
or shrank by gradual stages and passed into another, illustrate
with much force and clearness the nature of the change and growth,
revival and decay, which go on from year to year in more important
matters of life. In books, again, we see each writer not for and
by himself, but occupying his proper place in history; we look
through each philosopher, mathematician, chemist, poet, into the
background of his education&mdash;through Leibnitz into Descartes,
through Dalton into Priestly, through Milton into Homer.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Tylor, Edward B.: <i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. I.
pp. 17 ff.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides understanding the present better in terms of its history,
there is much in the heritage of the past, especially of its finished
products, that the citizen of contemporary civilization will wish
preserved for its own sake. The works of art, of music, and of
literature which are handed down to us are "possessions forever."
Whatever be the limitations of our social inheritance, as instruments
for the solution of our difficulties, those finished products which
constitute the "best <a name="page_270"><span class="page">Page
270</span></a> that has been known and thought" in the world are
beyond cavil. They may not solve our problems, but they immensely
enrich and broaden our lives. They are enjoyed because they are
intrinsically beautiful, but also because they widen men's sympathies
and broaden the scope of contemporary purposes and ideals.
</p>

<p class="include">
The culture that this transmission of racial experience makes possible,
can be made perfect by the critical spirit alone, and, indeed, may
be said to be one with it. For who is the true critic but he who
bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad
generations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional
impulse obscure. And who is the true man of culture, if not he in
whom fine scholarship and fastidious rejection... develops that
spirit of disinterested curiosity which is the real spirit, as it
is the real fruit of the intellectual life, and thus attains to
intellectual clarity; and having learned the best that is known
and thought in the world, lives&mdash;it is not fanciful to say
so&mdash;among the Immortals.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Oscar Wilde: <i>Intentions</i>, pp. 192-93.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The student of Greek life knows that the Greeks in their view of
Nature and of morals, in their conception of the way life should
be lived, in their discrimination of the beautiful, have still
much to teach us. He knows, however much we may have outlived the
hierarchy of obedience which constitutes medi&aelig;val social
and political life, we should do well to recover the humility in
living, the craftsmanship in industry, and precision in thinking
which constituted so conspicuous features of medi&aelig;val
civilization. He knows that progress is not altogether measured
by flying machines and wireless telegraphy. He is aware that speed
and quantity, the key values in an industrial civilization, are not
the only values that ever have been, or ever should be cherished
by mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Limitations of the past.</b> Along with a sensitive appreciation
of the achievements and values of the past, goes, in the impartial
critic, an acknowledgment of its limitations. We can appreciate
the distinctive contributions of Greek culture without setting up
Greek life as an ultimate ideal. We know that with all the beauty
attained and expressed in <a name="page_271"><span class="page">Page
271</span></a> their art and, to a certain extent, in their
civilization, the Athenians yet sacrificed the majority to a life of
slavery in order that the minority might lead a life of the spirit,
that their religion had its notable crudities and cruelties, that
their science was trivial, and their control of Nature negligible.
In the words of one of their most thoroughgoing admirers:
</p>

<p class="include">
The harmony of the Greeks contained in itself the factors of its
own destruction. And in spite of the fascination which constantly
fixes our gaze on that fairest and happiest halting place in the
secular march of man, it was not there, any more than here, that
he was destined to find an ultimate reconciliation and repose.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: G. Lowes Dickinson: <i>Greek View of Life</i>, p. 248.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, we know the many beautiful features of medi&aelig;val life
through its painting and poetry and religion. We know Saint Francis
and are familiar with the heroic records of saintliness and
renunciation. We know, the great cathedrals, the pageantry and
splendor, the exquisite handicraft, the tapestries and illuminated
manuscripts, the vast learning and the incomparable dialectic. We
know also the social injustices, the misery and squalor the ignorance
in which the mass of the people lived.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We can stop, therefore, neither in perpetual adoration of nor perpetual
caviling at the past. Each age had its special excellences and
its special defects, both from the point of view of the ideals
then current, and those current in our own day. In so far as the
past is dead and over with, we cannot legitimately criticize it
with standards of our own day. We cannot blame the Greeks for
sanctioning slavery, nor criticize James I because he was not a
thoroughgoing democrat. But in so far as the past still lives, it
is open to critical examination and revision. Traditions, customs,
ideas, and institutions inherited from the past, which still control
us, are subject to modification. We are justified in welcoming
changes and modifications which, after careful inquiry, seem clearly
to promise betterment in the life of the group. Thus to welcome
<a name="page_272"><span class="page">Page 272</span></a> changes
which upon experimental evidence show clearly the benefits that
will accrue to the group, is not radicalism. Nor is opposition
to changes on the ground that upon critical examination they give
promise of harmful consequences, conservatism. Verdicts for or against
change reached on such a basis reflect the spirit and technique of
experimental science. They reflect the desire to settle a course
of action on the basis of its results in practice rather than on
any preconceived prejudices in favor either of stability or change.
To the critical mind, neither stability nor change is an end in
itself. There is no hypnotism about "things as they are"; no lure
about things as they have not yet been. The problem is shifted
to a detailed and thoroughgoing inquiry into the consequences of
specific changes in social habits, ideas and institutions, education,
business, and industry. Whether changes should or should not win
critical approval depends on the kind of ideals or purposes we
set ourselves and, secondly, on the practicability of the proposed
changes. Change may thus be opposed or approved, in a given case,
on the grounds of desirability or feasibility. Whether a change
is or is not desirable depends on the ideals of the individual
or the group. Whether it is or is not feasible is a matter open
increasingly to scientific determination. Thus a city may hire
experts to discover what kind of transportation or educational
system will best serve the city's needs. But whether it will or
will not spend the money necessary depends on the social interests
current.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Education as the transmitter of the past.</b> Education is the
process by which society undertakes the transmission of its social
heritage. Indeed the main function of education in static societies
is the initiation of the young into already established customs and
traditions. It is the method used to hand down those social habits
which the influential and articulate classes in a society regard as
important enough to have early fixed in its young members. The past
is simply transmitted, handed down <i>en masse</i>. It is a set of
patterns <a name="page_273"><span class="page">Page 273</span></a> to
be imitated, of ideals to be continued, of mechanisms for attaining
the fixed purposes which are current in the group.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In progressive societies education may be used not simply to hand
down habits of doing, feeling, and thinking, from the older generation
to the younger, but to make habitual in the young reflective
consideration of the ends which must be attained, and reflective
inquiry into the means for attaining them. The past will not be
handed down in indiscriminate completeness. The present and its
problems are regarded as the standard of importance, and the past
is considered as an incomparable reservoir of materials and methods
which may contribute to the ends sought in the present. But there
is so much material and so little time, that selection must be
made. Many things in the past, interesting on their own merits,
must be omitted in favor of those habits, traditions, and recorded
files of knowledge which are most fruitful and enlightening in
the attainment of contemporary purposes. What those purposes are
depends, of course, on ideals of the group in control of the process
of education. But these purposes of ideals may be derived from
present situations and not taken merely because they have long
been current in the group. Thus, in a predominantly industrial
civilization, it may be found more advisable and important to transmit
the scientific and technical methods of control which men have
acquired in recent generations than the traditional liberal arts.
Science may be found more important than the humanities, medicine
than moral theory. Even such education that tends to call itself
"liberal" or "cultural" is effective and genuine education just
in so far as it does illuminate the world in which we live. The
religion and art, the literature and life of the past broaden the
meaning and the background of our lives. They are valuable just
because they do enrich the lives of those who are exposed to their
influence. If studying the great literature and the art of the
past did not clarify the mind and emancipate the spirit, enabling
men to live more richly in the present, they would hardly be as
studiously cherished and transmitted <a name="page_274"><span
class="page">Page 274</span></a> as they are. We are, after all,
living in the present. The culture of the past either does or does
not illuminate it. If it does not it is a competing environment,
a shadow world in which we may play truant from actuality, but
which brings neither "sweetness nor light" to the actual world in
which we live.

PART II</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE CAREER OF REASON</p>

<p class="indent">
The foregoing analysis of human behavior might thus be briefly
summarized. We found that man is born a creature with certain tendencies
to act in certain definite ways, tendencies which he largely possesses
in common with the lower animals. We found also that man could learn
by trial and error, that his original instinctive equipment could
be modified. Thus far in his mental life man is indistinguishable
from the beasts. But man's peculiar capacity, it appeared, lay in
his ability to think, to control his actions in the light of a
future, to choose one response rather than another because of its
consequences, which he could foresee and prefer. This capacity
for reflection, for formulating a purpose and being able to obtain
it, we found to be practical in its origins, but persisting on its
own account in the disinterested inquiry of philosophy and science
and the free imaginative construction of art. And in all man's
behavior, whether on the plane of instinct, habit, or reflection,
we found action to be accompanied by emotion, by love and hate,
anger and awe, which might at once impede action by confusing it,
or sustain it by giving it a vivid and compelling motive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The second part of the book was devoted to an analysis of the various
specific traits which human beings display and the consequences
that these have in men's relations with one another. Under certain
conditions, one or another of these may become predominant; in
particular historical conditions, one or another of them may have
a high social value or the reverse. These traits vary in different
individuals; in any of them, a man may be totally defective or
abnormally developed. But taken in general, they constitute the
changeless pattern <a name="page_276"><span class="page">Page
276</span></a> of human nature, and fix the conditions and the limits
of action.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while these universal traits determine what man may do, and
fix definitively the boundaries of human possibility, within these
limits the race has a wide choice of ideals and attainments. The
standards of what man will and should do, within the boundaries
of the nature which is his inheritance, are to be found not in his
original impulses, but in his mind and imagination. The human being
is gifted with the ability to imagine a future more desirable than
the present, and to contrive ingeniously in behalf of anticipated
or imagined goods.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These anticipated goods we call ideals, and these ideals arise,
in the last analysis, out of the initial and inborn hungers and
cravings of men. "Intellect is of the same flesh and blood with
all the instincts, a brother whose superiority lies in his power to
appreciate, harmonize, and save them all." The function of reason
is not to set itself over against men's original desires, but to
envisage ideals and devise instruments whereby they may all, so
far as nature allows, be fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Man's reason, then, which has its roots in his instincts, is the
means of their harmonious fulfillment. It attempts, in the various
fields of experience, to effect an adjustment between man's competing
desires, and between man and his environment. If instincts were
left each to its own free course, they would all be frustrated;
if man did not learn reflectively to control his environment, and
to make it subserve his own ends, he would be a helpless pygmy soon
obliterated by the incomparably more powerful forces of Nature.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These various attempts of man to effect an adjustment of his passions
with one another, and his life to his environment, may be described
as the "Career of Reason." In this career man has formulated many
ideals, not a small number of which have led him into error,
disillusion, and unhappiness. Sometimes they have misled him by
promising him fulfillments that were in the nature of things
unattainable. They have <a name="page_277"><span class="page">Page
277</span></a> added to the real evils of life a longing after
impossible goods, goods which an informed intelligence would early
have dismissed as unattainable. Man has disappointed himself by
counting on joys which, had he been less incorrigibly addicted to
imaginative illusions, he should never have expected. Sometimes
he has framed ideals which could be fulfilled, but only at the
expense of a large proportion of natural and irrepressible human
desires. Such, for example, have been the one-sided ascetic ideals
of Stoicism or Puritanism, which in their attempt to give order
and form to life, crush and distort a considerable portion of it.
The same is true of mysticism which seeks frequently to attain life
by altogether denying its instinctive animal basis. Yet though
reason has led men astray, it is the only and ultimate hope of
man's happiness. It is responsible for whatever success man has
had in mastering the turmoil of his own passions and the obstacles
of an environment "which was not made for him but in which he grew."
It has given point and justice to Swinburne's exultant boast:
</p>

<p class="include">
"Glory to man in the highest! For man is the master of things!"
</p>

<p class="indent">
This Career of Reason has taken various parallel fulfillments,
and in each of them man has in varying degrees attained mastery.
Religion arose as one of the earliest ways by which man attempted
to win for himself a secure place in the cosmic order. Science,
in its earliest forms hardly distinguishable from religion, is
man's persistent attempt to discover the nature of things, and to
exploit that discovery for his own good. Art is again an instance
of man's march toward mastery. Beginning, in the broadest sense,
in the industrial arts, in agriculture and handicrafts, it passes,
as it were by accident, from the necessary to the beautiful. Having
in his needful business fortuitously created beautiful objects,
man comes to create them intentionally, both for their own sake
and for the sheer pleasure of creation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Finally in morals men have endeavored to construct for <a
name="page_278"><span class="page">Page 278</span></a> themselves
codes of conduct, ideals of life, in which no possible good should
be needlessly or recklessly sacrificed, and in which men might
live together as happily as is permitted by the nature which is
at once their life and their habitation. The Career of Reason in
these various fields we shall briefly trace and describe. We must
expect to find, as in any career, however successful, failures along
with the triumphs, and, as in any notable career still unfinished,
possibility and great promise. Man's reason and imagination have
a long past; they have also an indefinite future. Man has in the
name of reason made many errors; but to reason he owes his chief
success, and with increasing experience he may be expected to attain
continually to a more certain and effective wisdom. With these
provisos, let us address ourselves to the Career of Reason, beginning
with religion.
</p>

<h2><a name="page_279"><span class="page">Page 279</span></a>
CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">RELIGION AND THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The religious experience.</b> Since human nature remains constant
in its essential traits, despite the variations it exhibits among
different individuals, it is to be expected that certain experiences
should be fairly common and recurrent among all human beings. Joy
and sorrow, love and hate, jubilance and despair, disillusion and
rapture, triumph and frustration, these occur often, and to every
man. They are, as it were, the sparks generated by the friction of
human desires with the natural world in which they must, if anywhere,
find fulfillment. Just such a normal, inevitable consequence of
human nature in a natural world is the religious experience. It
is common in more or less intense degree to almost all men, and
may be studied objectively just as may any of the other universal
experiences of mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, however, certain peculiar difficulties in the study
of the religious experience. Most men are by training emotionally
committed to one particular religious creed which it is very difficult
for them impartially to examine or to compare with others. In the
second place, there is a confusion in the minds of most people
between the personal religious experience, and the formal and external
institution we commonly have in mind when we speak of "religion."
When we ordinarily use the term, we imply a set of dogmas, an
institution, a reasoned theology, a ritual, a priesthood, all the
apparatus and earmarks of institutionalized religion. We think of
Christianity, Mohammedanism, Judaism, the whole welter of churches
and creeds that have appeared in the history of mankind. But these are
rather the outward vehicles and vestments of the religious experience
than the experience itself. They are the social expressions and
external instruments <a name="page_280"><span class="page">Page
280</span></a> of the inner spiritual occurrence. But the latter is
primary. If man had not <i>first been religious</i>, these would
never have arisen. In the words of William James:
</p>

<p class="include">
In one sense at least, the personal religion will prove itself
more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism. Churches
when once established live at second hand upon tradition, but the
<i>founders</i> of every Church owed their power originally to
the fact of their direct personal communion with the divine. Not
only the superhuman founders, the Christ, the Buddha, Mahomet,
but all the originators of Christian sects have been in this case;
so personal religion should still seem the primordial thing, even
to those who esteem it incomplete.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, p. 30.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Before we examine the social institutions and fixed apparatus of
ritual and of reasoned theology in which the religious experience has
become variously embodied, we must pause to analyze the experience
itself. To be religious, as a personal experience, is, like being
philosophical, to take a total attitude toward the universe. But the
religious attitude is one of a somewhat specific kind. It is, one
may arbitrarily but also somewhat fairly say, to sense or comprehend
one's relation to the divine, however the divine be conceived. It
is to have this sense and comprehension not only deeply, as one
might in a poetic or a philosophical mood, but to have it suffused
with reverence. We shall presently see that the objects of veneration
have had a different meaning for different individuals, groups, and
generations. But whatever be the conception of the divine object, the
religious attitude seems to have this stable feature. It is always
an awed awareness on the part of the individual of his relation to
that "something not himself," and larger than himself, with whom
the destinies of the universe seem to rest. This somehow sensed
relation to the divine appears throughout all the varieties of
religion that have appeared in the world, and among many individuals
not popularly accounted religious.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is just such an experience, for example, that Wordsworth <a
name="page_281"><span class="page">Page 281</span></a> expresses
when he says in the "Lines Written Above Tintern Abbey":
</p>

<p class="bquote">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"... And I have felt<br />
&nbsp; A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br />
&nbsp; Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br />
&nbsp; Of something far more deeply interfused,<br />
&nbsp; Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br />
&nbsp; And the round ocean and the living air,<br />
&nbsp; And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;<br />
&nbsp; A motion and a spirit, that impels<br />
&nbsp; All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br />
&nbsp; And rolls through all things."
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is the same sense that comes over so-called worldly people when
oppressed suddenly by a great sorrow, or uplifted by a sudden great
joy, an awareness of a divine power that moves masterfully and
mysteriously through the events of life, provoking on the part of
finite creatures a strange and compelling reverence. This "divinity that
shapes our ends" may be variously conceived. It may be an intimately
realized personal God, "Our Father which art in Heaven." It may be
such an abstract conception as the Laws of Nature or Scientific
Law, such a religion as is expounded by the Transcendentalists, in
particular by Emerson:
</p>

<p class="include">
These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space,
and not subject to circumstance: thus in the soul of man there
is a justice whose retributions are instant and entire.... If a
man is at heart just, then, in so far is he God; the safety of
God, the immortality of God, the majesty of God, do enter into
that man with justice.... For all things proceed out of the same
spirit, which is differently named, love, justice, temperance, in
its different applications, just as the ocean receives different
names on the several shores which it washes.... The perception of
this law awakens in the mind a sentiment which we call the religious
sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its
power to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the
embalmer of the world. It makes the sky and the hills sublime,
and the silent song of the stars is it. It is the beatitude of

In all these conceptions it still seems to be a hushed sense of
reverential relationship to the divine power that most specifically
constitutes the religious experience. The latter exhibits certain
recurrent elements, any of which may be present in a more intense
degree in some individuals than in others, but all of which appear
in some degree in most of the phenomena of personal life that we
call religious.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>"The reality of the unseen."</b> In the first place may be noted
the sense of the actuality and nearness of the divine power, what
James calls the "reality of the unseen," and what is frequently
spoken of by religious men as "the presence of God." James quotes
in this connection an interesting letter of James Russell Lowell's:
</p>

<p class="include">
I had a revelation last Friday evening.... Happening to say something
of the presence of spirits of whom, as I said, I was often dimly
aware, Mr. Putnam entered into an argument with me on spiritual
matters. As I was speaking, the whole system seemed to rise up
before me, like a vague destiny looming from the abyss. I never
before felt the spirit of God so keenly in me, and around me. The
whole room seemed to me full of God. The air seemed to waver to
and fro with the presence of something I knew not what. I spoke
with the calmness and clearness of a prophet.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Lowell: <i>Letters</i>, I, p. 75.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The archives of the psychology of religion are crowded with instances
of men who have felt deeply, intimately, and irrefutably the near
and actual presence of God. This sense of the reality of an unseen
Thing or Power is not always identified <a name="page_283"><span
class="page">Page 283</span></a> with God. There come moments in
the lives of normal men and women when the world of experience
seems alive with something that is apprehended through none of
the five senses. There are times when things unseen, unheard, and
untouched seem to have, nay, for those concerned, do have, a clearer
and more unmistakable reality than the things we can touch, hear,
and see. Sometimes, in the hearing of beautiful music, we sense
a transcendent beauty which is something other than, something
more real than, the specific harmonies which we physically hear.
In rare moments of rapture, when the imagination or the affections
are intensely stirred, we become intensely aware of this reality
which is made known to us through none of the ordinary avenues of
experience. The Unseen is not only vividly felt, but is deeply felt
and regarded as a thing of deep significance, and is experienced
in most cases with great inexplicable joy. And, not infrequently,
this significant and beautiful Unseen Somewhat is identified with
God.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sense of the reality of the divine, is, however, as it were,
only the prerequisite of the religious experience. When an individual
does have this sense, what interests the student of the psychology of
religion is the attitude it provokes and the satisfactions it gives.
These we can the better understand if we examine the conditions in
an individual's experience which make this longing for the divine
presence acute, and the general circumstances of human life which
make it a continuous desire in many people.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are, to begin with, constant facts of experience which make
the realization of the divine presence not only a satisfaction,
but the indispensable "staff of life" for certain human beings. In
their unfaltering faith in God's enduring and proximate actuality
lies their sole source of security and trust. For such persons
a lapse or a lack of faith is the prelude to utter collapse. A
vague general assurance of the dependability of the future is, for
most people, a prerequisite for a sane and untroubled existence.
Even those who live in unreflective <a name="page_284"><span
class="page">Page 284</span></a> satisfaction with the fruits of
the moment would find these moments less satisfactory were they
not set in a background of reasonably fair promise. The exuberant
optimist, when he stops to reflect, has a buoyant and inclusive
faith in the essential goodness of man and the universe. Whitman
stands out in this connection as the classic type. Evil and good
were to him indifferently beautiful. He maintained an incredibly
large-hearted and magnanimous receptivity to all things great or
small, charming or ugly, that lightened or blackened the face of
the planet.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While the average man accepts the universe with a less wholesale
and indiscriminate appreciation, yet he does feel vaguely assured
that the nature of things is ordered, harmonious, dependable, and
regular, that affairs are, cosmically speaking, in a sound state.
He feels a vast and comfortable solidity about the frame of things
in which his life is set; he can depend on the familiar risings
and settings of the sun, the recurrent and assured movement of
the seasons. Were this trust suddenly removed, were the cosmic
guarantee withdrawn, to live would be one long mortal terror. That
this is precisely what does happen under such circumstances, the
voluminous literature of melancholia sufficiently proves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sense of insecurity takes various forms. Sometimes the patient
experiences a profound and intimate conviction of the unreality
of the world about him. His whole physical environment comes to
seem a mere phantasy and a delusion. In some cases he finds himself
unmoved by the normal interests and excitements of men, unable to
find any stimulus, value, or significance in the world.
</p>

<p class="include">
Esquirol observed the case of a very intelligent magistrate.... Every
emotion appeared dead within him. He manifested neither perversion
nor violence, but a complete absence of emotional reaction. If
he went to the theater, which he did out of habit, he could find
no pleasure there. The thought of his house, of his home, of his
wife, and of his absent children, moved him as little, he said,
as a theorem of Euclid.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Ribot: <i>Psychology of the Emotions</i>, p. 54.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_285"><span class="page">Page 285</span></a> The sense
of futility, of the flatness, staleness, and unprofitableness of
the world, which is felt in such extreme forms by pronounced
melancholiacs, is experienced sometimes, though to a lesser degree,
by every sensitive mind that reflects much upon life. Such an attitude,
it is true, arises principally during moments of fatigue and low
vitality, and is undoubtedly organic in its origins, as for that
matter is optimism. Again such a sense of world-weariness comes
often in moments of personal disappointment and disillusion, when
friends have proved false, ambitions empty, efforts wasted. At such
times even the normal man echoes Swinburne's beautiful melancholy:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"We are not sure of sorrow,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And joy was never sure,<br />
&nbsp; To-day will die to-morrow,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time stoops to no man's lure;<br />
&nbsp; And love grown faint and fretful,<br />
&nbsp; With lips but half regretful,<br />
&nbsp; Sighs, and with eyes forgetful,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weeps that no loves endure.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"From too much love of living,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From hope and fear set free,<br />
&nbsp; We thank with brief thanksgiving,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever gods may be,<br />
&nbsp; That no life lives, forever;<br />
&nbsp; That dead men rise up never;<br />
&nbsp; That even the weariest river,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winds somewhere safe to sea."[1]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even the eager and exuberant, if sufficiently philosophical and
generous-minded, may come, despite their own success, to a deep
realization of the utter futility, meaninglessness, and stupidity
of life, of the essential blindnesses, cruelties, and insecurities
which seem to characterize the nature of things. Unless against
this dark insight some reassuring faith arises, life may become
almost unbearable. In extreme cases it has driven men to suicide.
Take, for example, the picture of the universe as modern materialism
presents it:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_286"><span class="page">Page 286</span></a>
Purposeless... and void of meaning is the world which science reveals
for our belief.... That man is the product of causes that had no
prevision of the end they were achieving, that his origin, his growth,
his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs, are but the outcome of
accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no
intensity of thought or feeling can preserve an individual life
beyond the grave, that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion,
all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius
are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system,
and that the whole temple of man's achievements must inevitably be
buried beneath the d&eacute;bris of a universe in ruins&mdash;all
these things if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain
that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within
the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of
unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely
built.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
Such a prospect to the serious-minded and sensitive-spirited cannot
but provoke the profoundest melancholy. There is, even for the most
healthy-minded of us, sufficient ground for pessimism, bitterness,
insecurity. Even if we personally&mdash;largely through the accidents
of circumstance&mdash;happen to be successful, "our joy is a vulgar
glee, not unlike the snicker of any rogue at his success." The
utter futility and evanescence of earthly goods, beauties, and
achievements is sensed at least sometimes by normally complacent
souls. And so patent and ubiquitous are the evidences of decay,
disease, and death at our disposal, that they may easily be erected
into a thoroughgoing philosophy of life:
</p>

<p class="include">
Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities, all
is vanity.
</p>

<p class="include">

All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous
and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the
good so is the sinner; and he that sweareth as he that feareth
an oath....
</p>

their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither

</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: <i>Ecclesiastes</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Religion offers solace to those perturbed and passionate souls,
among others, to whom these futilities have become a rankling,
continuous torment and depression. When life on earth appears
fragmentary and disordered, not only nonsense but terrifying nonsense,
full of hideous injustices, sickening uncertainties, and cruel
destructions, men have not infrequently found a refuge in the divine.
"Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the religious experience man finds life to be made clear, complete,
and beautiful. What seems a contradictory fragment finds its precise
niche in the divine scheme, what seems dark and cruel shines out
in a setting of eternal beneficence and wisdom. The experience of
the individual, even the happiest, is always partial, broken, and
disordered. No ideal is ever completely realized, or if realized
leaves some perfection to be desired. Men living in a natural existence
imagine values and ideals which can never be realized there. In
religion, if anywhere, men have found perfection, and ultimate
sufficiency.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This perfection, completion, and clarification of life has been
attained in various ways. The religious experience itself, when
intense, may give to the individual apart from a reasoned judgment,
or from any actual change in his physical surroundings, a translucent
insight during which he sees deeply, calmly, joyously into the
beautiful eternal order of things. This mystic insight has been
experienced on occasion by quite normal and prosaic men and women.
While it lasts, reality seems to take on new colors and dimensions.
It becomes vivid, luminous, and intense. The mystic seems to rise to
a higher level of consciousness, in which he experiences a universe
more significant, ordered, and unified than any commonly experienced
through the senses. One may take, <a name="page_288"><span
class="page">Page 288</span></a> as an example, such an instance
autobiographically and anonymously reported a few years ago, and
well documented:
</p>

<p class="include">
It was not that for a few keyed-up moments I <i>imagined</i> all
existence as beautiful, but that my inner vision was cleared to the
truth so that I <i>saw</i> the actual loveliness which is always
there, but which we so rarely perceive; and I knew that every man,
woman, bird, and tree, every living thing before me, was extravagantly
beautiful, and extravagantly important. And as I beheld, my heart
melted out of me in a rapture of love and delight. A nurse was
walking past; the wind caught a strand of her hair and blew it
out in a momentary gleam of sunshine, and never in my life before
had I seen how beautiful beyond all belief is a woman's hair. Nor
had I ever guessed how marvelous it is for a human being to walk.
As for the internes in their white suits, I had never realized
before the whiteness of white linen; but much more than that, I
had never so much as dreamed of the beauty of young manhood. A
little sparrow chirped and flew to a near-by branch, and I honestly
believe that only "the morning stars singing together, and the sons
of God shouting for joy" can in the least express the ecstasy of
a bird's flight. I cannot express it, but I have seen it.
</p>

<p class="include">
Once out of all the gray days of my life I have looked into the
heart of reality; I have witnessed the truth; I have seen life
as it really is&mdash;ravishingly, ecstatically, madly beautiful,
and filled to overflowing with a wild joy, and a value unspeakable.
For those glorified moments I was in love with every living thing
before me&mdash;the trees in the wind, the little birds flying,
the nurses, the internes, the people who came and went. There was
nothing that was alive that was not a miracle. Just to be alive
was in itself a miracle. My very soul flowed out of me in a great
joy.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "Twenty Minutes of Reality," <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>,
vol. 117, p. 592.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The mystic experience is important in the study of religion because
it has so frequently given those who have had it a very real feeling
of "cosmic consciousness." The individual feels "for one luminously
transparent conscious moment," at one with the universe; he has a
realization at once rapturous and tranquil of the passionate and
wonderful significance of things. He has moved "from the chill
periphery to the radiant core." All the discrepancies which bestrew
ordinary life are absent. All the negations of disappointment, all
conflicts <a name="page_289"><span class="page">Page 289</span></a>
of desire disappear. The mystic lives perfection at first hand:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The One remains, the many change and pass,<br />
&nbsp; Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly,<br />
&nbsp; Life, like a dome of many colored glass,<br />
&nbsp; Stains the white radiance of eternity."
</p>

<p class="indent">
This sense of splendid unity in which all the divisive and corroding
elements of selfhood are obliterated has "to those who have been
there" no refutation. "It is," writes William James, "an open question
whether mystic states may not be superior points of view, windows
through which the mind looks out on a more extensive and inclusive
world."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Whatever be the logical validity of the intense mystical insight,
of his singular gift for a vivid and intimate union with eternity
which has been known by so many mystics, the fruits of this insight
are undeniable. During such a vision the world is perfect. There is
no fever or confusion, but rapture and rest. And to some degree,
at a religious service, a momentous crisis, joy at deliverance or
resignation at calamity, during beatific interludes of friendship
or of love, men have felt a clear enveloping oneness with divinity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such states of intense religious experience, however, are as transient
as they are ineffable. Though they recur, they are not continuous,
and something more than occasional vivid unions with the divine
enter into the constant perfection with which the world, as it
appears to the religious man, is endowed. He feels himself, in
the first place, to be part of a world scheme in which ultimate
perfection is secured. It has already been pointed out that any
individual human life is characterized by negation, conflict, and
disappointment. Our lives seem largely to be at the mercy of
circumstance. Our inheritance is fixed for us without our connivance
in the matter; accident determines in which social environment we
happen to be born. And these two facts are the chief determinants
of our careers. Even when successful we realize either the emptiness
of the prize we had desired, or the distance we are in reality from
<a name="page_290"><span class="page">Page 290</span></a> the goal
we had set ourselves. Generalizing thus from his own experience, the
individual notes the similar disheartening discrepancies throughout
human life. He sees the good suffer, and the wicked prosper; the
innocent die, and the guilty escape. Disease is no respecter of
persons, and death comes to the just and the unjust alike.
</p>

<p class="include" style="text-indent: 0em;">
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?<br />
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
offspring before their eyes.<br />

Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon
them.<br />

Their bull gendereth and faileth not; their cow calveth and casteth
not her calf.<br />

They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children
dance.<br />

They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound
of the organ.<br />

They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment
go down to the grave.<br />

Therefore they say unto God; depart from us, for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways.<br />

What is the Almighty that we should serve him? And what profit
should we have if we pray unto him?[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Job, chap. XXI.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In contrast, in the religious experience man feels himself to be
a part of a world scheme in which justice and righteousness are
assured by an incontestable and invulnerable power; "God's in his
Heaven; all's right with the world." Despite the grounds he has
for doubt, Job robustly avers: "Though he slay me, yet will I trust
in him." Calamities are but temporary; God will bring all things
to a beautiful fruition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Or a man may feel that the evils he or others experience here are
not real evils, that, seen <i>sub specie &oelig;ternitatis</i>, they
would cease to be regarded as such. He may feel that God moves in
a mysterious way his wonders to perform, that "somehow good may
come of ill." He may feel, as does the Christian believer, that
all the evils and pains unjustly experienced in this world will be
adjusted in the next. Whatever be my privations from earthly good,
"in my Father's house <a name="page_291"><span class="page">Page
291</span></a> are many mansions." Immortality is, indeed, the
religious man's faith in a second chance. The surety of a world
to come, in which the blessed shall live in eternal bliss, is a
compensation and a redress for the ills and frustrations of life
in this world. Whatever be the seeming ills or injustices of life,
there is eventual retribution, both to the just and the unjust.
Once more to quote Emerson:
</p>

<p class="include">
And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the
understanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a mutilation,
a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems
at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal
the deep remedial force that underlies all facts. The death of a dear
friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation,
somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it
commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an
epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks
up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows
the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.
It permits or constrains the formation of new acquaintances, and
the reception of new influences that prove of the first importance
to the next years; and the man or woman who would have remained
a sunny garden flower, with no room for its roots and too much
sunshine for its head, by the falling of the walls and the neglect
of the gardener, is made the banian of the forest, yielding shade
and fruit to wide neighbourhoods of men.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Emerson: <i>Essay on Compensation</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On a larger scale, from the cosmic rather than from the personal
point of view, an individual, gifted with a large and charitable
interest in the future of mankind, is secured and sustained by
the feeling that he is a part of that procession headed to the
"one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves." The
lugubrious picture of an utterly meaningless world, blind, purposeless,
and heartless, which materialistic science reveals, is sufficient
to wreck the equanimity of a sensitive and thoughtful mind.
</p>

<p class="include">
That is the sting of it, that in the vast drifting of the cosmic
weather, though many a jewelled shore appears, and many an enchanted
cloud-bank floats away, long lingering ere it be dissolved&mdash;even
<a name="page_292"><span class="page">Page 292</span></a> as our world
now lingers for our joy&mdash;yet when these transient products are
gone, nothing, absolutely <i>nothing</i> remains. Dead and gone
are they, gone utterly from the very sphere and room of being.
Without an echo, without a memory; without an influence on aught
that may come after, to make it care for similar ideals. This utter
wreck and tragedy is of the essence of scientific materialism, as
at present understood.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Pragmatism</i>, p. 105.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
A belief that a divine power governs the universe, that all these
miscellaneous and inexplicable happenings will be gathered up into
a smooth and ultimate perfection, gives faith, comfort, and solace.
We are on the side of the angels, or rather the angels are on our
side. Human passion, purpose, and endeavor are not wasted. They
are small but not altogether negligible contributions to eventual
cosmic good. And good is eventual. Perfection may be long delayed,
but God's presence assures it. "Weeping may endure for a night,
but joy cometh in the morning."
</p>

<p class="include">
A world with a God in it to say the last word may indeed burn up
or freeze, but we then think of Him as still mindful of the old
ideals, and sure to bring them elsewhere to fruition; so that where
He is, tragedy is only provisional and partial, and shipwreck and
dissolution not the absolutely final things.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 106.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Amid tragic errors and pitiful disillusions, men have yearned for
"a benediction perfect and complete where they might cease to suffer
and desire." This perfection religion has, as we have seen, accorded
them in various ways. Some have found it in the immediate vision,
the ecstatic union with the divine that, in intense degree, is
peculiarly the mystic's. Some have found it in the assured belief
that evil is itself an illusion, and, if rightly conceived, a beautiful
dark shadow to set off by contrast the high lights of a divinely
ordered cosmos, a minor note giving lyric and lovely poignancy to
the celestial music. Some have rested their faith in a perfect
world not here, but hereafter, "where the blessed would enter eternal
bliss with God their master." Thus man has in religion found <a
name="page_293"><span class="page">Page 293</span></a> the fulfillment
of his ideals, which always outrun the actualities amid which he
lives. In the religious experience, in all of its forms throughout
the ages, man has had the experience of perfection at first hand,
in the immediate and rich intensity of the mystic ecstasy, in the
serene faith of a lifelong intuition or of a reasoned belief in
the ultimate divinely assured rightness of things.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides experiencing perfection, man has, in the sense of security
and trust afforded by the religious experience, found release from
the fret, the fever, the compulsion, and constriction under which
so much of life must be lived. Whatever happens, the truly devout
man has no fears or qualms. He has attained equanimity; the Lord
is his shepherd; he shall not want. There is a serenity experienced
by the genuinely faithful that the faithless may well envy. God is
the believer's eternal watcher; a wise and merciful Providence,
his infinite guarantee.
</p>

<p class="include">
Whoever not only says but feels, "God's will be done" is mailed
against every weakness; and the whole historic array of martyrs,
missionaries and religious reformers is there to prove the
tranquil-mindedness, under naturally agitating or distressing
circumstances, which self-surrender brings.[1]

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James; <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, p.

</p>

<p class="indent">
But peace is attained not only through faith in the fulfillment of
desire, but in a marked lessening in the tension of desire itself,
in a large and spacious freedom attained through release from the
confinement of self. We saw in the chapter on the Consciousness of Self
how much exertion and energy may be devoted to the enhancement of Self
through fame, achievement, social distinction, power, or possession.
We saw how, in the frustration of self, the germ of great tragedy lay.
From the tragedy and bitterness of such frustration men have often
been reassured by a genuine conversion to the religious life. Through
the negation of self rather than through its fulfillment men have
found solace and rest. And <a name="page_294"><span class="page">Page

consisted in a rapturous submission to the will of God.

<b>Experiences which frequently find religious expression.</b>
The religious experience, as pointed out in the beginning of this
discussion, has its roots in the same impulses which cause men
to love and to hate, to be jubilant and sorrowful, exalted and
depressed. All these human experiences sometimes take a religious
form, that is, their expressions have some reference to the supernatural
and the divine. We find, in surveying the history of religion,
that certain experiences more than others tend to find religious
expression. We shall examine a few of the chief of these.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Need and impotence.</b> An awed, almost frightened sense of
dependence overcomes even the most robust and healthy-minded man
when he sees the forces of Nature suddenly unloosed on a magnificent
scale. A terrific peal of thunder, an earthquake or a cyclone will
send thrills of terror through the normally calm and self-sufficient.
Even apart from such vivid and terrifying examples of the range and
scale of non-human power, there comes to the reflective a sense of
the frailty of human life, of the utter dependability of all human
purposes and plans on conditions beyond human control. In our most
fundamental industry, agriculture, an untimely frost can undo the work
of the most ingenious industry and thrift. A tornado or a snowstorm can
disorganize the cunning and subtle, swift mechanisms of communication
which men have invented. In the field of humanly built-up relations,
again, a <a name="page_295"><span class="page">Page 295</span></a>
fortune or a friendship may depend on some chance meeting; a man's
profession and ideals are fixed by a single fortuitous conversation,
by a chance encouragement, opportunity or frustration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is thus a psychological though perhaps not literal truth
in the figure of Fate, or in the metaphor that speaks of human
destiny as lying on the knees of the gods. Action so often wanders
from intent, so much in the best-laid plans is at the mercy of
external circumstance! A creature whose being can be snuffed out
in a moment, whose life is less than an instant in the magnificent
perspective of eternity, comes not unnaturally to be aware of his own
insignificance as compared with those vast forces, some auspicious
and some terrible, which are patently afoot in the world.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But as patent a fact as man's impotence is his desire. The individual
realizes how powerless is a human being to fulfill, independently of
external forces, those impulses with which these same inexplicable
forces have launched him into the world. Thus do we feel even to-day
when we have learned that the forces of Nature, obdurate to the
ignorant, yet become flexible and fruitful under the knowing
manipulation of science. We realize that despite our cunning and
contrivance, our successes are, as it were, largely matters of
grace; the changes we can make in Nature are as nothing to the slow,
gradual processes by which Nature makes mountains into molehills,
builds and destroys continents, develops man out of the lower animals,
and, by varying climates and topographies, affects the destinies
of nations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To primitive man the sense of impotence and need were not derived
from any general reflections upon the insecurity of man's place
in the cosmos, but rather from the sharp pressure of practical
necessity.
</p>

<p class="include">
The helplessness of primitive man set down in the midst of a universe
of which he knew not the laws, may perhaps be brought home to the
mind of modern man, if we compare the universe to a vast workshop
full of the most various and highly-complicated machinery <a
name="page_296"><span class="page">Page 296</span></a> working
at full speed. The machinery, if properly handled, is capable of
producing everything that the heart of primitive man can wish for, but
also, if he sets hand to the wrong part of the machinery, is capable
of whirling him off between its wheels, and crushing and killing him
in its inexorable and ruthless movement. Further, primitive man
cannot decline to submit himself to the perilous test: he must make
his experiments or perish, and even so his survival is conditional
on his selecting the right part of the machine to handle. Nor can
he take his own time and study the dangerous mechanism long and
carefully before setting his hand to it: his needs are pressing
and his action must be immediate.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Jevons: <i>An Introduction to the History of Religion</i>,

</p>

<p class="indent">
The very food of primitive man was to him as precarious as it was
essential. His life was practically at the mercy of wind and rain
and sun. His food and shelter were desperately lucky chances. Not
having attained as yet to a conception of the impersonality of Nature,
he regarded these forces which helped and hindered him as friendly
and alien powers which it was in the imperative interests of his own
welfare to placate and propitiate. It was in this urgent sense of
helplessness and need that there were developed the two outstanding
modes of communication with the supernatural, <i>sacrifice</i> and
<i>prayer</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Primitive man conceived his universe to be governed by essentially
human powers; powers, of course, on a grand scale, but human none
the less, with the same weaknesses, moods, and humors as human
beings themselves. They could be flattered and cajoled; they could
be bribed and paid; they could be moved to tenderness, generosity,
and pity. "Holiness," says Socrates in one of Plato's dialogues,
"is an art in which gods and men do business with each other, ...
Sacrifice is giving to the gods, prayer is asking of them."[2]
In Frazer's <i>Golden Bough</i> one finds the remarkably diverse
sacrificial rites by which men have sought to win the favor of
the divine. Primitive man believed literally that the universe was
governed by superhuman personal powers; he believed literally that
these are human in their motives. He believed <a name="page_297"><span
class="page">Page 297</span></a> in consequence that sacrifices to
the gods would help him to control the controlling powers of Nature
for his own good, just as modern man believes that an application of
the laws of electricity and mechanics will help him to control the
natural world for his own purposes. The sacrifices of primitive
man were immensely practical in character; they were made at the
crucial moments and pivotal crises of life, at sowing and at harvest
time, at the initiation of the young into the responsibilities of
maturity, at times of pestilence, famine, or danger. The gods were
given the choice part of a meal; the prize calf; in some cases,
human sacrifices; the sacrifice, moreover, of the beautiful and
best. The chief sacrificial rites of almost all primitive peoples
are connected with food, the sustainer, and procreation or birth,
the perpetuator, of life.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: See Plato's <i>Euthyphro</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
As Jane Harrison puts it:
</p>

<p class="include">
If man the individual is to live, he must have food; if his race
is to persist, he must have children. To live and to cause to live,
to eat food and beget children, these were the primary wants of
man in the past, and they will be the primary wants of man in the
future, so long as the world lasts. Other things may be added to
enrich and beautify life, but unless these wants are first satisfied,
humanity itself must cease to exist. These two things, therefore,
were what men chiefly sought to procure by the performance of magical
rites for the regulation of the seasons.... What he realizes first
and foremost is that at certain times the animals, and still more
the plants, which form his food, appear, at certain others they
disappear. It is these times that become the central points, the
focusses of his interest, and the dates of his religious festivals.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Jane Harrison: <i>Ancient Art and Ritual</i>, p. 31.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sacrifice is only one way primitive man contrives of winning the
favor of the gods toward the satisfaction of his desires. Another
common method is prayer. In its crudest form prayer is a direct
petition from the individual to divinity for the grant of a specific
favor. The individual seeks a kindness from a supernatural power
whose motives are human, and who may, therefore, be moved by human
appeals; whose power is superhuman and can therefore fulfill requests.
<a name="page_298"><span class="page">Page 298</span></a> Prayer
may become profoundly spiritualized, but in its primitive form it
is, like sacrifice, a certain way of getting things done. They
are both to primitive man largely what our science is to us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both prayer and sacrifice arise in primitive man's need and helplessness
and terror before mysterious supernatural powers, but they may rise,
in the higher form of religion, to genuine nobility, from this crass
commerce with divinity, this religion of bargaining and <i>quid pro
quo</i>. Sacrifice may change from a desperate reluctant offering
made to please a jealous god, to a thanksgiving and a jubilation,
an overflowing of happiness, gratitude, and good-will.
</p>

<p class="include">
Greek writers of the fifth century B.C. have a way of speaking
of an attitude toward religion, as though it were wholly a thing
of joy and confidence, a friendly fellowship with the gods, whose
service is but a high festival for man. In Homer, sacrifice is but,
as it were, the signal for a banquet of abundant roast flesh and
sweet wine; we hear nothing of fasting, cleansing, and atonement.
This we might explain as part of the general splendid unreality of
the Greek saga, but sober historians of the fifth century B.C.
express the same spirit. Thucydides is by nature no reveller, yet
religion is to him, in the main, a rest from toil. He makes Pericles
say of the Athenians: Moreover we have provided for our spirit very
many opportunities of recreation, by the celebration of games and
sacrifices throughout the year.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Jane Harrison: <i>Prolegomena to Greek Religion</i>,
p. 1.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sacrifice may become spiritualized, as it is in Christianity, "instead
of he-goats and she-goats, there are substituted offerings of the
heart for all these vain oblations." The sacrificial heart has at
all times been accounted germane to nobility. There is something
akin to religion in the laying down of a life for a cause or a
country or a friend, in surrendering one's self for others. It
is this power and beauty of renunciation that is the spiritual
value behind all the rituals of sacrifice that still persist, as
in the sacraments of Christianity. It is the tragic necessity of
self-negation that haloes, even in secular life, the sacrificial
attitude:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_299"><span class="page">Page 299</span></a> But there
is in resignation a further good element. Even real goods when
they are attainable ought not to be fretfully desired. To every
man comes sooner or later the great renunciation. For the young
there is nothing unattainable; a good thing desired with the whole
force of a passionate will, and yet unattainable, is to them not
credible. Yet by death, by illness, by poverty, or, by the voice
of duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made
for us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave,
Fate may nevertheless forbid them. It is the part of courage, when
misfortune comes, to bear without repining the ruin of our hopes, to
turn away our thoughts from vain regrets. This degree of submission
to power is not only just and right; it is the very gate of wisdom.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bertrand Russell: <i>Philosophical Essays</i>, p. 65.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The spiritual meaning and value of sacrifice is thus seen to lie
in self-surrender. The human being, born into a world where choices
must be made, must make continual abnegation. And when the temporary
good is surrendered in the maintenance of an ideal, sacrifice becomes
genuinely spiritual in character.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Prayer, also, becomes genuinely spiritual in its values when one
ceases to believe in its practical efficacy and comes to think it
shameful to traffic with the divine. Prayer beautifully illustrates
a point previously noted, how speech oscillates between the expression
of feeling and the conveyance of ideas. Beginning in primitive
religion as a crude and cheap petition for favors, it becomes in
more spiritual religious experience, a lyric cry of emotion, a
tranquil and serene expression of the soul's desire. Prayer is,
moreover, "religion in act." That deep sense of an awed relationship
to divine power which was, in the beginning of this discussion, noted
as constituting certainly one of the outstanding characteristics
of the religious experience, finds its most adequate emotional
expression in prayer.
</p>

<p class="include">
Religion is nothing [writes Auguste Sabatier] if it be not the
vital act by which the entire mind seeks to save itself by clinging
to the principle from which it draws life. This act is prayer, by
which I understand no vain exercise of words, no mere repetition
of certain <a name="page_300"><span class="page">Page 300</span></a>
sacred formulas, but the very movement itself of the soul, putting
itself in a personal relation of contact with the mysterious power
of which it feels the presence&mdash;it may be even before it has a
name by which to call it. Wherever this interior prayer is lacking,
there is no religion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises
and stirs the soul, even in the absence of forms or doctrines, we
have religion.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: A. Sabatier: <i>Esquisse d'une Philosophie de la
Religion</i> (ed. 1897), pp. 24-26.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In prayer, furthermore, we may hope to find not the fulfillment
of our desires, but what our desires really are. We are released
temporarily from tension of temporal and selfish longings. We hold
a tranquil and reverential speech with a power not ourselves, and
in communion with the infinite purge ourselves of the dross of
immediate personal needs. In such a peaceful interlude we may find
at once clarity and rest. Prayer, at its highest, might be defined
as audible meditation, controlled by the sense of the divinity
of the power we are addressing. So that the truly spiritual man
prays not for the fulfillment of his own accidental longings, but
pleads rather: "Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of
my heart be acceptable in thy sight, 0 Lord, my strength and my
redeemer."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Fear and awe.</b> Man's attitude toward the divine was noted
to have arisen partly in his feeling of dependence on personal
forces incomparably superior to himself, and in his urgent need
for winning their favor. In primitive man this sense of dependence
was certainly bound up with a feeling of fear.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be borne in mind that uncivilized peoples had pathetically
little understanding or control of the forces of Nature. In consequence
on being afflicted with some sudden catastrophe of famine or disease,
on experiencing a sudden revelation in storm, wind, or volcanic
eruption, of the terrible magnificence of elemental forces, he
must have been struck with dread. He was living in a world that
appeared to him much less ordered and regular than ours appears to
us. His <a name="page_301"><span class="page">Page 301</span></a>
prayers and sacrifices were not always friendly and confidential
intercourse with the gods; they were as often ways of averting the
evils of malicious and terrifying demons. The enemies of religion
have been fond of pointing out how much of it has been a quaking
fear of the supernatural. It is in this spirit that Lucretius's
bitter attack is conceived.
</p>

<p class="include">
When the life of man lay foul to see and grovelling upon the earth,
crushed by the weight of religion, which showed her face from the
realms of heaven, lowering upon mortals with dreadful mien, 't
was a man of Greece who dared first to raise his mortal eyes to
meet her, and first to stand forth to meet her; him neither the
stories of the gods nor thunderbolts checked, nor the sky with
its revengeful roar, but all the more spurred the eager daring of
his mind to yearn to be the first to burst through the close-set
bolts upon the doors of nature.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Lucretius: <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, book I; lines 28-38.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Primitive man feared the gods as much as he needed them. Jane Harrison
points out, for example, that as great a part of Greek religion
was given over to the exorcising of the evil and jealous spirits
of the underworld, as in friendly communion with the beautiful
and gracious Olympians.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But what appears in the ignorant and harassed savage as fear may be
transformed in civilized man into awe. Long after man's crouching
physical terror of the divine has passed away, he may still live
awed by the ultimate power that orders the universe. He may, "at
twilight, or in a mountain gorge," at a ca&ntilde;on or waterfall,
experience an involuntary thrill and breathlessness, a deepened
sense of the divinity which so orders these things. He may have
the same feeling at the crises of life, at birth, disease, and
death. He may sense on occasion that overwhelming and infinite
power of which Job becomes aware, as he listens to the voice out
of the whirlwind:
</p>

<p class="include" style="text-indent: 0em;">
Who hath divided a water course for the overflowing of waters, or
  a way for the lightning of thunder?<br />
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;
  on the wilderness,  wherein there is no man;
<a name="page_302"><span class="page">Page 302</span></a><br />
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
  of the tender herb to spring forth? ...<br />
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or
  loose the bands of Orion? ...<br />
Knowest thou the ordinances of Heaven? Canst thou set the
  dominion thereof in the earth? ...<br />
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee,
Here we are?<br />
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given
  understanding to the heart?
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where man experiences such awe, he will become reverential, and,
if articulate, will express his reverence in prayer, again not
the prayer of practical requests for favors from God, but a hushed
meditation upon the assured eternity in which the precarious and
finite lives of men are set.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Regret, remorse&mdash;Repentance and penance.</b> Regret is
a sufficiently common human experience. There are for most men
wistful backward glances in which they realize what might have
been, what might have been done, what might have been accomplished.
For many this never rises above pique and bitterness over personal
failure, a chagrin, as it were, over having made the wrong move.
But to some regret may take on a deeply spiritual quality. Instead
of regretting merely the successes which he hoped, as it proved
vainly, to attain, a man may become passionately aware of his own
moral and spiritual shortcomings. This sense of dereliction and
delinquency may take extreme forms. James quotes a reminiscence
of Father Gratry, a Catholic philosopher:
</p>

<p class="include">
... All day long without respite I suffered an incurable and intolerable
desolation, verging on despair. I thought myself, in fact, rejected
by God, lost, damned! I felt something like the suffering of hell.
Before that I had never even thought of hell.... Now, and all at
once, I suffered in a measure what is suffered there.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Quoted by James in his <i>Varieties</i>, p. 146.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Normal individuals may come to a deep consciousness of having left
undone the things they ought to have done, of having done the things
they ought not to have done. This <a name="page_303"><span
class="page">Page 303</span></a> realization may be at once a
"consciousness of sin," and a desire for a new life. If it is the
consciousness of sin which becomes predominant, then a desolate and
tormenting remorse engulfs the individual. But the consciousness
of sin for the religious becomes simply a prelude to entrance upon a
better life. The awareness of past sins is combined in the religious,
especially in devout Christians, with faith in God's mercy, and in
his welcoming of the penitent sinner:
</p>

<p class="include" style="text-indent: 0em;">
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite
  heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />

Have mercy upon me, O God; according to thy loving kindness, blot
  out my transgressions.<br />

Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<br />

For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.<br />

Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
  whiter than snow.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again the New Testament call to repentance is symbolic of the experience
of millions of religious people. "Repent ye, for the kingdom of
Heaven is at hand." There is a terrible intensity and immediate
imperativeness about this call. But to all there comes at one time
or another an urgent sense of spiritual shortcoming and the desire
to lead a better life. The lamenting of sins becomes the least
part; what is important is the immense new impetus toward a better
life. The records of religious conversion are full of instances
where men by this sudden penitential revulsion from their past
life and a startled realization of new spiritual possibilities,
have broken away permanently from lifelong habitual vices. James
cites a case of an exceedingly belligerent and pugilistic collier
named Richard Weaver, who was by a sudden conversion to religion
not only made averse to fighting, but persistently meek and gentle
under provocation. Similar cases, genuine and well documented,
fill the archives of religious psychology.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The religious man in repenting knows that God will, if his repentance
is sincere, forgive him, and sustain and support him in his new
life.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_304"><span class="page">Page 304</span></a> I say
unto you that likewise Joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that
repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need
no repentance.
</p>

<p class="include">
I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God
over one sinner that repenteth.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Luke, 15: 7,10.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
While regret over sin, alienation from a past life of evil, and
a persistent dedication to a purified and righteous existence
constitute, spiritually, the phenomena of repentance and conversion,
repentance has had in religion certain fixed outward forms. If
sin had been committed, merely inward spiritual realization was
not sufficient, penance must be done. Penance in the early days
of the Christian Church was public. Later penance became a private
matter (public penance was suppressed by an ordinance of Pope Leo
I in 461 A.D.).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Private penance took various familiar forms, such as scourgings,
fastings on bread and water, reciting a given number of psalms,
prayers, and the like. Later penalties could be redeemed by alms.
A penitent would be excused from the prescribed works of penance at
the cost, <i>e. g.</i>, of equipping a soldier for the crusade, of
building a bridge or road. Gradually in the history of the Christian
religion, penances have been lightened. In the Protestant Church,
with the enunciation of the principle of justification through
faith alone there could be no sacrament of penance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One form in which the penitential mood receives expression is in
confession in which the penitent acknowledges his sins. There is no
space here to trace the development of this practice in religion.
It must suffice to point out that psychologically it is a cleansing
or purgation. It clears the moral atmosphere. It is a relief to
the tormented and remorseful soul to say "Peccavi," and to confide
either directly or indirectly to the divine the burden of his sins.
It is for many people the necessary pre-condition, as it is in
the Catholic Church, to penitence and the actual performance of
penance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The psychological value of confession varies with individual <a
name="page_305"><span class="page">Page 305</span></a> temperaments;
for many it is high. There are few so self-contained and self-sufficient
that they do not seek to express their emotions to others. It is not
surprising that the gregarious human creature should find confession
a restorative and a solace. Human beings are not only natively
responsive to the emotions of others, but by nature tend to express
their own emotions and to be gratified by a sympathetic response.
Emotions of any sort, joyous or sorrowful, find some articulation.
The oppressive consciousness of sin particularly must find an outlet
in expression. And the expression of sin must somewhere be received.
The wrong done rankles heavily in the private bosom. The crucified
soul demands a sympathetic spirit to receive its painful and personal
revelation. He that would confess his sins requires a listener of
a large and understanding heart. Just such a merciful, forgiving,
and understanding friend is the God whom Christianity pictures. God
waits with infinite patience for the confessions and the surrender
of the contrite heart. The normal human desire to rid one's self
of a tormenting secret, to "exteriorize one's rottenness," finds
satisfaction on an exalted plane in confession to God, or to his
appointed ministers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Joy and enthusiasm&mdash;Festivals and thanksgivings.</b> So far
our account has been confined to experiences in which man felt the
need or fear of the divine, because of his own desires, weaknesses, or
sins. But humans find religious expression for more joyous emotions.
Even primitive man lives not always in terror or in tribulation.
There are occasions, such as plentiful harvests, successful hunting,
the birth of children, which stir him to expressions of enthusiastic
appreciation and gratitude toward the divine. Some of the so-called
Dionysiac festivals in ancient Greece are examples of the enthusiasm,
joy, and abounding vitality to which religion has, among so many
other human experiences, given expression. In the religion of the
Old Testament, again, we find that the Psalmist is time and again
filled with rejoicing:
</p>

<p class="include" style="text-indent: 0em;">
<a name="page_306"><span class="page">Page 306</span></a><br />
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy endureth
forever.<br />
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy.<br />
And he gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the
west, from the north and from the south.<br />
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
city to dwell in.<br />
Hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them.<br />
Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivere
them out of their distresses.<br />
And he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city
of habitation.<br />
O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men.<br />
For he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry heart with
goodness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nor need this rejoicing be always an explicit thanksgiving for
favors received. It may be, as were the dithyrambic festivals of
Greece, the riotous overflow of enthusiasm, a joyous, sympathetic
exuberance with the vital processes of Nature. Dionysos stood for
fertility, life, gladness, all the positive, passionate, and jubilant
aspects of Nature. And the well-known satyr choruses, the wine
and dance and song of the Greek spring festivals, are classic and
beautiful illustrations of the religion of enthusiasm. Euripides
gives voice to this spirit in the song of the M&aelig;nads in the
<i>Bacch&oelig;</i>:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Will they ever come to me, ever again,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The long, long dances,<br />
&nbsp; On through the dark till the dim stars wane?<br />
&nbsp; Shall I feel the dew on my throat and the stream<br />
&nbsp; Of wind in my hair? Shall our white feet gleam<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the dim expanses?<br />
&nbsp; O feet of a fawn to the greenward fled,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alone in the grass and the loveliness?"[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Euripides: <i>Bacch&oelig;</i> (Gilbert Murray translation).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every religion has its festival as well as its fast days. Sacrifices
come to be held less as offerings to jealous gods than as sacrificial
feasts, in which the worshipers themselves partake, <a
name="page_307"><span class="page">Page 307</span></a> as opportunities
for communal rejoicings and for friendly fellowship with divinity.
At sacrificial feasts it is as if the gods themselves were at table.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Dance and song are a regular accompaniment of primitive religion.
Students of Greek drama, such as Jane Harrison and Gilbert Murray,
trace Greek tragedy back to the choruses and dances of early Dionysiac
festivals. Throughout the history of religion not only have man's
sorrow and need been expressed, but also his sympathetic gladness with
vitality, fertility, and growth, his rejoicings over the fruitions
and glad eventualities of experience. Man has felt the decay and
evanescence of human goods. He has felt also the exuberance of
natural processes, the triumph of life over death when a child
is born, the renewal of life by food, the recurrence of growth
and fertility in the processes of the seasons, of sowing and of
harvest. And for all these enrichments and enlargements of life,
he has rejoiced, and found rituals to express his rejoicings. He
has had the impulse and the energy to sing unto the Lord a new
song.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Theology.</b> Thus far we have discussed the religious experience
<i>as</i> an experience, as normal, natural, and inevitable as are
love and hate, melancholy and exaltation, joy and sorrow. Like these
latter, the religious experience is subjected to rationalization. Like
all other emotions, that of religion finds for itself a logic and a
justification. But so profoundly influential is "cosmic emotion" on
men's lives that when it is reasoned upon, the results are nothing
less than an attitude taken toward the whole of reality. Theology
arises as a world view formulated in accordance with a reasoned
interpretation of the religious experience. It must be noted again
that the experience is primary. If men had not first had the experience
of religion, they would not have reflected about it. Every contact
of the individual with the world to some degree arouses emotion and
provokes thought. It is not different with religion. That theologies
should differ and conflict is not surprising. No two individuals, no
two groups or ages have <a name="page_308"><span class="page">Page
308</span></a> precisely the same experiences of the world, and
their reasonings upon their religious feelings are bound to differ,
overlap, and at times to conflict. The variety of world views are
testimony to the genuineness of the religious experience as it
fulfills the different needs, emotions, and desires of different
ages, groups, and generations of men.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The description of the divine.</b> Reasonings upon religion
exhibit, like the religious emotions, certain recurrent features.
There is, in the first place, a certain universality in the description
of the objects of veneration. These are nearly always regarded as
self-sufficient in contrast with man. Man seeks, strives, desires,
has partial triumphs and pitiful failures, is always in travail
after some ideal. His life is incomplete; at best it is a high
aspiration; it is never really fulfilled. But divinity has nearly
always been regarded as seeking nothing, asking nothing, needing
nothing. This is what infinity in practical terms means. And, with
certain exceptions presently to be noted, the divine power has always
been regarded as infinite. Thus Aristotle says that in man's best
moments, when he lives in reflection a life of self-sufficiency, he
lives just such a life as God lives continually. And Plato describes
the philosopher as a man who because he can live, at least temporarily,
amid eternal, changeless beauty and truth, "lives in recollection
among those things among which God always abides, and in beholding
which God is what he is." Lucretius also gives a simple picture of
the even calmness and still, even security of the life of the gods
as he and all the Epicureans conceived it. Tennyson paraphrases
the picture:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"...The Gods, who haunt<br />
The lucid interspace of world and world,<br />
Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,<br />
Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,<br />
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,<br />
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar<br />
Their sacred everlasting calm!"[1]

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_309"><span class="page">Page 309</span></a> Divinity
has, again, quite universally been recognized as exerting over
the individual a compelling power, and of insistently arousing
his veneration. The psychological origins of this phenomenon have
already been noted. Men fear, need, feel themselves dependent on
the gods. But further than this many religious thinkers hold that
man cannot even be aware of the divine power without wishing to
adjust himself harmoniously to it. And they hold, as did Immanuel
Kant, that man is born with an awareness of the divine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The attributes of divinity have been differently assigned at different
times in the history of religion. In general two qualities have
been regarded as characteristic: power and goodness. In primitive
belief, the first received the predominant emphasis; the higher
religions have emphasized the second. For savage man, as we have
seen, the divine personages were conceived in effect as human beings
with superhuman powers. They were feared and flattered, needed and
praised. Adjustment to them was a practical, imperative necessity.
They combined infinite capacity with human and finite caprice. The
attention they received from humans was distinctly utilitarian in
character. These forces of wind and sun and rain might be brutal
or benignant. Primitive man established, therefore, a system of
magic, sacrifice, and prayer, whereby he might minimize the
precariousness of existence, and keep the gods on his side.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the more spiritualistic monotheistic religions, while the power
of God has been insistently reiterated, there has been an increasing
emphasis upon the divine goodness. The Psalmist is continually
referring to both:
</p>

<p class="include" style="text-indent: 0em;">
Praise ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good:
  for his mercy endureth forever.<br />
Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?<br />

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_310"><span class="page">Page 310</span></a> Wrath
and terror gradually give place to mercy and benevolence as the
primary attributes of the divine. The power of God, in Christianity,
for example, is still regarded as unlimited, but it is completely
expended in the loving salvation of mankind. Where the divinity
has ceased to be a willful power and has become instead the God
of mercy and loving kindness, it is no longer necessary to placate
him by material sacrifice, to win his favor by trivial earthly
gifts. Divine favor is sought rather by aspiration after and the
practice of a better life. The mighty but capricious deity gives
place to the God of unfailing charity and love. One earns God's
mercies by walking in the ways of the Lord. "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God.... Blessed are they which do
hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled."
In both Christianity and Judaism, God's grace and mercies go always
to the pure in heart, and the righteous in spirit. "What doth the
Lord require of thee," proclaims Micah, "but to do justly, and
to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God?"
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The divine as the human ideal.</b> There has been in certain
latter-day philosophies, a tendency to interpret the divine as
the objectification of human ideals. That is, according to this
theory, men have found in their imagined divinities the fulfillment
of ideals that they could never have realized on earth. Men, says
this theory, long to be immortal, so they imagine gods who are.
Finite man has infinite desires. In God is infinite fulfillment
through eternity. No men are all good; some desire to be. Such
fulfillment they find in the divine. Our conception of God is an
index of our own ideals. When men were savages, their divinity was
a jealous monster. In the refinement and spiritualization of the
human imagination, divinity becomes all-beautiful and all-benevolent
as well as the wielder of infinite power. John Stuart Mill gives
possibly the clearest expression to this attitude which is, if
not in the strictest sense religious, at least deeply spiritual:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_311"><span class="page">Page 311</span></a> Religion
and poetry address themselves, at least in one of their aspects,
to the same part of the human constitution; they both supply the
same want, that of ideal conceptions grander and more beautiful
than we see realized in the prose of human life. Religion, as
distinguished from poetry, is the product of the craving to know
whether these imaginative conceptions have realities, answering
to them in some other world than ours. The mind, in this state,
eagerly catches at any rumors respecting other worlds, especially
when delivered by persons whom it deems wiser than itself. To the
poetry of the supernatural, comes to be thus added a positive belief
and expectation, which unpoetical minds can share with the poetical.
Belief in a God or gods, and in a life after death, becomes the
canvas which every mind, according to its capacity, covers with
such ideal pictures as it can either invent or copy. In that other
life each hopes to find the good which he has failed to find on
earth, or the better which is suggested to him by the good which
on earth he has partially seen and known. More especially this
belief supplies the finer minds with material for conceptions of
beings more awful than they <i>can</i> have known on earth, and
more excellent than they probably <i>have</i> known.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Three Essays on Religion</i> (Henry Holt &amp;
Co.), pp. 103-04.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In his religion, Mill maintains, man thus finds the fulfillment of
unfulfilled desire. Religion is thus conceived as an imaginative
enterprise of a very high and satisfying kind. It peoples the world
with perfections, not true perhaps to actual experience, but true to
man's highest aspirations. It gives man companionship with divinity
at least in imagination. It enables him to live, at least spiritually,
in such a universe as his highest hopes and desires would have
him live in, in fact. It must be pointed out, however, that the
devoutly religious do not regard their God as a beautiful fiction,
but as a dear reality whom they can serenely trust and love, and
whose existence is the certain faith by which they live.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The religious experience, theology, and science.</b> It has
already been pointed out that theology is the reasoned formulation
of the religious experience which comes to men with varying degrees
of intensity, or the revelation by which some man, a Moses or a
Mohammed, has been inspired. Such a formulation has a dual importance.
For the individual it brings clarity, order, and stability into his
religious experience. <a name="page_312"><span class="page">Page
312</span></a> For the group, it makes possible the social transmission
of religious conceptions and ideals.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reason in a man's religion, as in any other experience, introduces
stability, consistency, and order. It makes distinctions; it resolves
doubts, confusions, and uncertainties. It is true that there have
been in religion, as in politics and morals, rebels against reason.
There have been mystics who preferred their warm ecstatic visions to
the cold formulations and abstractions of theology. But there have
been, on the other hand, those gifted or handicapped, according to
one's point of view, by an insistence on reason as well as rapture
in their religion. These have not been satisfied with an intuition
of God. They have wished to know God, as the highest possible object
of knowledge. Thus in the Middle Ages philosophy and science were
regarded as the Handmaids of Theology. All was dedicated to, as
nothing could be more important than, a knowledge of God. So we
have, in contrast with ecstatic visions of God, the plodding analysis
of the scholastics, the subtle and clean-cut logic by which such
men as Saint Anselm sought to give form, clarity, and ultimacy to
their sense of the reality of God. There has possibly nowhere in the
history of thought been subtler and more thoroughgoing analysis than
some of the medi&aelig;val schoolmen lavished upon the clarification
and demonstration of the concept of God. The necessity for reasoning
upon one's sense of the reality of the divine, as it was felt by
many medi&aelig;val schoolmen, is thus stated by one historian:
</p>

<p class="include">
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury ... is the true type of the schoolman;
firmly convinced of the truth of the dogmas and yet possessed of a
strong philosophical impulse, he seeks to prove to reason what has
to be accepted on authority. He bravely includes in his attempt
to rationalize the faith not only such general propositions as the
existence of God, but the entire church scheme of salvation, the
Trinity, and Incarnation, and the Redemption of man. We must believe
the Catholic doctrine&mdash;that is beyond cavil&mdash;but we should
also try to understand what we believe, understand <i>why</i> it
is true.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thilly: <i>History of Philosophy</i>, p. 169.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_313"><span class="page">Page 313</span></a> But theology
has public as well as purely private importance. It must not be
forgotten that religion is a social habit as well as a personal
activity. From primitive life down to our own day, religion has
been intimately associated with the other social activities of
a people, and has indeed been one of the chief institutions of
moral and social control. Ethical standards have been until very
recent times in the history of Christian Europe almost exclusively
derived from religion. Where the religious experience is of such
crucial importance, it has been necessary to give it a fixed form and
content which might be used to initiate the young and the outsider.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Theology, though essentially a product of reflection upon the religious
experience itself, tends to incorporate extra-religious material
into its system. In its demonstration of the divine order and of
man's relationship to the divine, it incorporates both science and
history. Science becomes for it the manifestation of the divine
arrangements of the universe; history becomes a revelation of the
divine purpose and its realization. In primitive belief science
and religion are practically indistinguishable from each other.
The way of the gods is the way of the universe. The attribution
of personal motives to the gods was primitive man's literal and
serious way of conceiving the government of the cosmos. He believed
himself actually to be living in a world governed by living and
personal powers, an animistic world. The myths which describe the
birth and life of the gods, the creation of man, the bestowing of
the gift of fire are conceived as the literal and natural history
of creation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Christianity affords a striking example of how theology incorporates
science and natural history into its world view. For the early
Christian Fathers, natural science was interesting and useful in
so far as it illustrated, which it did, the ways of God upon earth.
</p>

<p class="include">
"The sole interest [of the Fathers] in natural fact," writes Henry
Osborn Taylor, "lay in its confirmatory evidence of Scriptural truth.
They were constantly impelled to understand facts in conformity <a
name="page_314"><span class="page">Page 314</span></a> with their
understanding of Scripture, and to accept or deny accordingly. Thus
Augustine denies the existence of Antipodes, men on the opposite
side of the earth, who walk with their feet opposite to our own.
That did not harmonize with his general conception of spiritual
cosmogony."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: H. O. Taylor: <i>The Medi&oelig;val Mind</i>, vol. I, pp.
75-76.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
All the natural science current, as represented, for example, in
the compilation called the <i>Physailogus</i>, is used as symbolical
of the ways of the Lord to man.
</p>

<p class="include">
The Pelican is distinguished by its love for its young. As these
begin to grow they strike at their parents' faces, and the parents
strike back and kill them. Then the parents take pity, and on the
third day the mother comes and opens her side and lets the blood
flow on the dead young ones, and they become alive again. Thus
God cast off mankind after the Fall, and delivered them over to
death; but he took pity on us, as a mother, for by the Crucifixion
He awoke us with His blood to eternal life.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Thilly: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 76.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
History is treated in the same way. Nearly all the histories written
by the early Christian Fathers were written in deliberate advocacy
of the Faith. It was to silence the heresies of those who attributed
to the Church the entrance of Alaric into Rome that Augustine wrote
his famous <i>City of God</i>. The whole of history is a revelation
of the divine purpose which is eventually to be fulfilled. Orosius,
again, a disciple of Augustine, wrote his <i>Seven Books of Histories
against the Pagans</i> to prove the abundance of calamities which had
afflicted mankind before the birth of Christ. He gathers together
all the evidence he can to exhibit at once the patience and the
power of God. "Straitened and anxious minds" might not be able
to see the purpose always, but all was ordained for one end. Thus
he writes at the beginning of his seventh book:
</p>

<p class="include">
The human race from the beginning was so created and appointed
that living under religion with peace without labor, by the fruit
of obedience it might merit eternity; but it abused the Creator's
goodness, turned liberty into wilful license, and through disdain
fell into forgetfulness; now the patience of God is just and doubly
just, operating <a name="page_315"><span class="page">Page
315</span></a> that this disdain might not wholly ruin those whom
He wished to spare ... and also so that He might always hold out
guidance although to an ignorant creature, to whom if penitent
He would mercifully restore the means to grace.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Orosius: <i>Seven Books of Histories against the
Pagans</i>, II, 3.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
History thus comes to reveal the fulfillment of the divine purpose,
as science reveals the divine arrangements of the universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It has already been noted that theology, certainly Christian theology,
maintains that God is all-good. In consequence the natural world
which scientific inquiry reveals must be all-good in its operations
and its fruits. The history of the universe must be a steady and
unfaltering fulfillment of the divine, of the beneficent eternal
purpose. The ways of the Almighty, so theology tells us, are just
ways, and the universe in which we live, so theology tells us,
is a revelation of that justice. The eighteenth century "natural
theologians" spent much energy in demonstrating how perfectly adapted
to his needs are man's natural environment and his organic structure.
They pointed to the eye with its delicate membranes so subtly adapted
to the function of sight. All Nature was a continuous and magnificent
revelation of God's designs, which were good. Christian Wolff, for
example, a rationalistic theologian of the late eighteenth century,
writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
God has created the sun to keep the changeable conditions on the
earth in such an order that living creatures, men and beasts, may
inhabit its surface.... The sun makes daylight not only on our earth,
but also on the other planets; and daylight is of the utmost utility
to us; for by its means we can commodiously carry on those occupations
which in the night-time would either be quite impossible, or at any
rate impossible without our going to the expense of artificial
light.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Christian Wolff: <i>Vern&uuml;nftige Gedanken von den
Absichten der nat&uuml;rlichen Dinge</i>, 1782, pp. 74 ff.; quoted

</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Mechanistic science and theology.</b> With the rise of mechanistic
science there has come about a sharp collision between <a
name="page_316"><span class="page">Page 316</span></a> the conception
of the goodness of the universe as theology declares it, and of
its blindnesses and indifference as science seems to unfold it
to us. Contrast the picture of a cosmos which was deliberately
and considerately made by God to serve every exigency of man's
welfare, with the picture earlier quoted from Bertrand Russell as
the natural scientist gives it to us. It is no longer easy to say
the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his
handiwork. As far as we can see natural processes go on without the
slightest reference to the welfare of man, who is but an accidental
product of their indifferent forces. The universe is a system of
blind regularities. "Omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless
way." Nature is thoroughly impersonal, and indeed, were it to be
judged by personal or human standards, it could with more accuracy
be maintained that it is evil than that it is good. As Mill puts
it in a famous passage:
</p>

<p class="include">
In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned
for doing to one another, are Nature's everyday performances. Killing,
the most criminal act recognized by human laws, Nature does once to
every being that lives, and in a large proportion of cases, after
protracted tortures such as only the greatest monsters whom we read
of ever purposely inflicted on their living fellow-creatures....
Nature impales men, breaks them as if on the wheel, casts them to
be devoured by wild beasts, burns them to death, crushes them with
stones like the first Christian martyr, starves them with hunger,
freezes them with cold, poisons them by the quick or slow venom of
her exhalations.... A single hurricane destroys the hopes of a
season; a flight of locusts or an inundation desolates a district;
a trifling chemical change in an edible root starves a million of
people.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Three Essays on Religion</i> (Holt), pp. 28-30.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The theology which insists on the patent and ubiquitous evidences
of God's beneficent purpose, attempts, as already pointed out,
to demonstrate that purpose in the history of mankind. Orthodox
Christian doctrine, for example, insists that man has been especially
created by God, as were the other animals each after their kind,
and that man's ultimate <a name="page_317"><span class="page">Page
317</span></a> and unique destiny is salvation through God's grace.
Man was created in perfection in the Garden of Eden, sinned, and
will, through God's mercy, find eventual redemption.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Following the publication of Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i>, in 1859,
the rapid spread of evolutionary doctrine aroused violent opposition
on the part of Christian thinkers and devout Christians generally. In
the first place it conflicted sharply with the orthodox version of
special creation. Secondly, it made more difficult the insistence on
marks of design or purpose in Nature. These two points will be clearer
after a brief consideration of the nature of Darwinian evolution,
with whose thoroughgoing mechanical principles nineteenth-century
theology came most bitterly in conflict. The theory explains the
origins of species, somewhat as follows:
</p>

<p class="indent">
The variety of species now current developed out of simpler forms
of animal life, from which they are lineally descended. Their present
forms and structures are modifications from the common forms possessed
by their remote ancestors. These modifications are, in the stricter
forms of Darwinian evolution, explained in mechanical terms by the
theory of the "survival of the fittest." That is, those animals
with variations adapted to their environment survive; those without,
perish. In consequence when any individual in a species happens
to be born with a variation specially adapted to its environment,
in the sharp "struggle for existence" that characterizes animal
life in a state of nature, it alone will be able to survive and
reproduce its kind. All the variations of species current are,
therefore, examples of this continuous process of descent with
adaptive modifications. The origin of the human species came about
through just such a variation or mutation from one of the higher
mammals (we have reason to believe, a species similar to that of
the anthrapoid ape). Man's ancestry, it seems, from the scientific
evidence which has been marshaled, may be traced back biologically,
in an almost unbroken chain to unicellular animals.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: For detailed discussion see Scott: <i>Theory of
Evolution</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_318"><span class="page">Page 318</span></a> This
theory profoundly affected theological thinking. In the first place,
the evolutionary account not only of the origin of man, but of
the origin of all species, as a descent with modification from
simpler-animal forms, conflicts with the account of special creation,
certainly in the literal form of the Biblical story. Secondly, the
arguments from design which had been drawn from the adaptation
of organic life to environment were, if not disproved, at least
rendered dubious. Although evolution did not account for the first
appearance of life on earth, it did account for the processes of
adaptation, and without invoking design or purpose.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The eye, for example, as explained by the theory of evolution,
came to its present perfection through a series of fortunate and
cumulative variations through successive generations. Even in its
imperfect form, it was a variation with high "survival value." Even
when it was no more than a pigmented spot peculiarly sensitive
to light, so the theory holds, it was a variation that enabled a
species to survive and perpetuate its kind. Those not possessing
these fortunate variations were wiped out. The process of Nature,
certainly, in the development of biological life thus appears to
be no economical convergence of means upon an end. Nature has been
recklessly prodigal. Millions more seeds of life are produced than
ever come to fruition. And only animals perfectly adapted to their
environment survive, while an incomparably greater number perish.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Theology, when it incorporates science and sets itself up as a
direct and factual description of the universe, thus comes sharply
in rivalry with modern mechanistic science. The conflict is crucial
with regard to the purpose which theology holds to be evident in
the universe, and the lack of purpose, the purely blind regularity,
which science seems to reveal. The mechanical laws by which natural
processes take place exhibit a fixed and changeless regularity,
in which man's good or ill counts absolutely nothing. The earth
instead of being the center of the solar system, is a cosmic accident
thrown <a name="page_319"><span class="page">Page 319</span></a>
out into space. Man instead of being a little lower than the angels
is revealed by science as a little higher than the ape.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is no space in these pages to trace the various reconciliations
that have been made between theology and science. It must be pointed
out, however, that Christian theology has increasingly accepted
modern mechanistic doctrines, including the doctrine of evolution.
But it has attempted to show that, granting all the facts of physical
science, the universe does still exhibit the divine purpose and
its essential beneficence. The very order and symmetry of physical
law have been taken as testimony of divine instigation. Mechanism
was set in motion by God. In answer to this, it is pointed out by
the non-theologian that then God's goodness cannot be maintained.
Mechanical processes are indiscriminate in their distribution of
goods and evils to the just and the unjust:
</p>

<p class="include">
All this Nature does with the most supercilious disregard both of
mercy and of justice, emptying her shafts upon the best and noblest,
indifferently with the meanest and worst; upon those who are engaged
in the highest and worthiest enterprises, and often as the direct
consequence of the noblest acts; and it might almost be imagined
as a punishment for them. She mows down those on whose existence
hangs the well-being of a whole people; perhaps the prospects of
the human race for generations to come, with as little compunction
as those whose death is a relief to themselves, or a blessing to
those under their noxious influence.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Three Essays on Religion</i> (Holt), p. 29.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Modern theology sometimes grants the apparent reality of the evils
which are current in a mechanistic world, but insists that they
are making for goods which we with our finite understanding cannot
comprehend. Were our intelligence infinite, as is God's, we should
see how "somehow good will be the final goal of ill."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Evolution has also been explained as God's method of accomplishing
his ends. By some evolutionists, Driesch and Bergson for example,
evolution itself, in its steady production of higher types, has
been held to be too purposive in character <a name="page_320"><span
class="page">Page 320</span></a> to permit of a purely mechanical
explanation. The process of evolution has itself thus come to be
taken by some theologians as a clear manifestation of God's beneficent
power at work in the universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But theology, in the more spiritualistic religions, has always
insisted on the primacy of God's goodness. There has been, therefore,
in certain theological quarters the tendency to surrender the conception
of divine omnipotence in the face of the genuine human evils that
are among the fruits of blind mechanical forces. The idea of a
finite God who is infinitely good in his intentions, but limited
in his powers, has been advocated by such various types of mind
as John Stuart Mill, William James, and H. G. Wells. The first
mentioned of these writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
One only form of belief in the supernatural&mdash;one theory respecting
the origin and government of the universe&mdash;stands wholly clear
both of intellectual contradiction and of moral obliquity. It is
that which, resigning irrevocably the idea of an omnipotent creator,
regards Nature and Life not as the expression throughout of the
moral character and purpose of the Deity, but as the product of a
struggle between contriving goodness and an intractable material,
as was believed by Plato, or a principle of evil as was believed
by the Manicheans. A creed like this ... allows it to be believed
that all the mass of evils which exists was undesigned by, and
exists not by the appointment of, but in spite of the Being whom
we are called upon to worship.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>loc, cit.</i>, p. 116.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Religion and science.</b> While there have thus been genuine
points of conflict between theology and science, these are essentially
irrelevant to the religious experience itself. Man is still moved by
the same emotions, sensations, needs, and desires which have, from
the dawn of history, provoked in him a sense of his relationship
with the divine. There comes to nearly all individuals at some
time, not without rapture, a sudden awareness of divinity.
</p>

<p class="include">
It is the terror and beauty of phenomena, the "promise" of the dawn
and of the rainbow, the "voice" of the thunder, the "gentleness"
<a name="page_321"><span class="page">Page 321</span></a> of the
summer rain, the "sublimity" of the stars, and not the physical laws
which these things follow, by which the religious mind continues
to be most impressed; and just as of yore, the devout man tells
you that in the solitude of his room or of the fields he still
feels the divine presence, that inflowing of help come in reply
to his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill
him with security and peace.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, p.
498.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Modern man, just as his savage ancestor cowering before forces he
did not understand, realizes sometimes&mdash;some persons realize it
always&mdash;how comparatively helpless is man amid the magnificent
and eternal forces in which his own life is infinitesimally set.
Even when one has been educated to the sober prose of science, one
feels still the ancient emotions of joy, sorrow, and regret. Birth
and death, sowing and harvest, conquest or calamity, as of old,
evoke a sympathetic feeling with the movement of cosmic processes.
All of these emotions to-day, as in less sophisticated times, may
take religious form.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nor does the universe because we understand it better seem, to
many, less worthy of worship. The most thorough-going scientific
geniuses have felt most deeply the nobility and grandeur of that
infinite harmony and order which their own genius has helped to
discover. It has been well said the "undevout astronomer is mad."
And it is not only the student of the stars who has intimations
of divinity. As Professor Keyser puts it: "The cosmic times and
spaces of modern science are more impressive and more mysterious
than a Mosaic cosmogony or Plato's crystal spheres. Day is just
as mysterious as night, the mystery of knowledge is more wonderful
and awesome than the darkness of the unknown."[2] It is significant
that such men as Newton, Pasteur, and Faraday, giants of modern
physical inquiry, were devoutly religious.

It would appear indeed that the objects which men revere are not
the subject-matter of science. Physics and chemistry <a
name="page_322"><span class="page">Page 322</span></a> can tell
us what Nature is like; they cannot tell us to what in Nature we
shall give our faith and our allegiance. Religion remains, as ever,
"loyalty to the highest values of life." Science instead of making
the world less awesome has made it more mysterious than ever. Origins
and destinies are still unknown. Science tells how; it describes.
It does not tell why things occur as they do; or what is the
significance of their occurrence. Worship can never be reduced to
molecules or atoms. While man lives and wonders, hopes and fears,
feels the clear beauty, the infinite mystery, and the eternal
significance of things, the religious experience will remain, and
men will find objects worthy of their worship.

<p class="indent">
<b>The church as a social institution.</b> Religion being so crucial
a set of social habits, institutions arise for the perpetuation
of its traditions, and for the social expression of the religious
life. The churches perpetuate the religious tradition in a number
of ways. Fixed ecclesiastical systems, recitals and definitions
of creeds, the regular and meticulous performance of rites and
ceremonies, become powerful instruments for the transmission of
religious ideas and standards. Rites frequently performed by men
in mass have a deep and moving influence. They have at once all
the pressure and prestige of custom, confirmed by the mystery and
awe that attends any expression of man's relationship to the divine.
The church, moreover, by the mere fact of being an institution,
having a hierarchy, an ordered procedure, a definite assignment and
division of ecclesiastical labor, becomes thereby an incomparable
preserver and transmitter of traditional values.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Churches, ecclesiastical organizations in general, may be said
to arise because of the necessity felt by men for intermediaries
between themselves and the divine. We have already seen of what
vast practical moment in savage life was communication with the
gods. Upon the success of such addresses to deity, depended not
only the salvation of the soul, but the actual welfare of the
body&mdash;shelter, harvest, and victory. The gods among many tribes
were held to be <a name="page_323"><span class="page">Page
323</span></a> meticulous about the forms and ceremonies which
men addressed to them. In consequence it became important to have,
as it were, experts in the supernatural, men who knew how to win
the favor of these watchful powers. The priests were originally
identical with medicine men and magicians. They knew the workings
of the providential forces. In their hands lay, at least indirectly,
the welfare of the tribe. Their principal duties were to administer
and give advice as to the worship of the gods. Often it was necessary
for them to point out to the lay members of the tribe which gods
to worship on special occasions. The priests being accredited with
a superior knowledge of the ways of the gods, they were required
to influence the wind and rain, to cause good growth, to ensure
success in hunting and fishing, to cure illness, to foretell the
future, to work harm upon enemies.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: For a detailed discussion see Hastings: <i>Encyclop&oelig;dia
of Religion and Ethics</i>, vol. II, pp. 278-335.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is more than one criterion by which men may be set apart as
priests. Sometimes they are those who in a mystic state of ecstasy
are supposed to be inspired by the gods. During their trance such
men are questioned as to the will of the divine. Sometimes they
become renowned through their reputed performance of an occasional
miracle. Again, as magical and religious ceremonies become more
complicated, there is a deliberate training of an expert class
to perform these essential acts. And, whatever be the source of
the selection of the priestly class, the immense influence which
their functions are regarded as having on the welfare of the tribe
causes them to be particularly revered and often feared by the lay
members of the tribe. In more civilized and spiritual religions,
the priestly or professional ecclesiastical class is no longer
regarded as possessed of magical powers by which it can coerce
divinity. It is the official administrator of the ceremonies of
religion, is especially trained, versed and certificated in doctrine,
is empowered to receive confession, fix penance, and the like.
It is still an intermediary between <a name="page_324"><span
class="page">Page 324</span></a> man and the divine, although itself
not possessing any supernatural powers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where ecclesiastical organization is highly developed and has become
controlling in the life of a people, it may be one of the most
powerful forces in social life. Such, for example, might be said
of the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages:
</p>

<p class="include">
A life in the Church, for the Church, through the Church; a life
which she blessed in mass at morning and sent to peaceful rest
by the vesper hymn; a life which she supported by the constantly
recurring stimulus of the sacraments, relieving it by confession,
purifying it by penance, admonishing it by the presentation of
visible objects for contemplation and worship&mdash;this was the
life which they of the Middle Ages conceived as the rightful life
of Man; it was the actual life of many, the ideal of all.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bryce: <i>Holy Roman Empire</i>, p. 423.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Churches may also come to acquire political functions. The history of
the Church is for many centuries the leading factor in the political
history of Europe, nor is it only in Christendom that political
institutions have been inextricably associated with religion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Religious institutions may, as pointed out in the case of primitive
tribes, acquire educational functions. The initiation ceremonies
in Australian tribes have a markedly religious character. In the
higher and more modern religions educational functions still persist.
The Catholic Church has been regarded as the educator of Europe.
Charlemagne's endowment and encouragement of education was largely
made effectual through the Church. The grammarians and didactic
writers, the poets, the encyclop&aelig;dists, the teachers whom
Charlemagne endowed and gathered about him, the heads of the schools
which he founded, were all churchmen. Until very recently in the
history of Europe the universities and education in general were
nearly all under the domination of the Church. The secularization of
primary education in England took place only late in the nineteenth
century, and it <a name="page_325"><span class="page">Page
325</span></a> is not yet a generation since the battle over the
secularization of education was waged in France. All religious
sects maintain on a smaller or larger scale educational functions.
Parochial and convent schools and denominational colleges are
contemporary examples.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The social consequences of institutionalized religion.</b> The
consequences of institutionalized religion in social development
have been very marked. The mere association of large groups in a
common faith and a common religious interest has been a considerable
factor in their integration. There is to be noted in the first place
the common emotional sympathies aroused by the participation of
great numbers in identical rites and ceremonies. Any widespread
social habit becomes weighted with emotional values for its members.
Particularly is this true of religious habits, the mystery and
magnificence associated with which deeply intensify their emotional
influence. Again religious habits are given a unanimous and high
social approval, especially where the prohibitions and commands
enforced by religion are conceived intimately to affect the welfare
of the tribe. The prophets reiterated to the people of Israel that
their calamities were the result of their having ceased to follow in
the ways of the Lord. The possession of a common religious history
and tradition may also give a people a deepened sense of group
solidarity. The national development of the ancient Hebrews was
undoubtedly promoted by their sense of being the chosen people,
of possessing exclusively the law of Jehovah.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again religious sanction is given to codes of belief, modes of
conduct, and to institutions, thus at once strengthening them and
making change difficult. It is not merely customs that are obeyed
and disobeyed, but the sacred commands. A premium is put upon the
regular and traditional because of the divine sanction associated
with them. To violate a prohibition, even a slight one, becomes thus
the most terrible sacrilege. Customs that, like the hygienic rules
of the Mosaic code, may have started as genuine social utilities are
maintained <a name="page_326"><span class="page">Page 326</span></a>
because they have become fixed in the religious traditions as enjoined
by the Lord. In consequence there may be a Pharisaical insistence on
the performance of the letter of the law, long after its practical
utility or spiritual significance is forgotten. It is this persistence
in the literal fulfillments of religious commands at the expense
of the spirit, that the Hebrew prophets so vehemently condemned.
Thus proclaims Isaiah:
</p>

<p class="include">
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? Saith
the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat
of fed beasts....
</p>

<p class="include">
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me....
</p>

<p class="include">
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are
a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them....
</p>

<p class="include">
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
</p>

<p class="include">
Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Isaiah I: 11-17.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Institutions and modes of life, even when they are not, strictly
speaking, part of the religious tradition proper, are given tremendous
sanction and confirmation when they become embodied in the religious
tradition. The institution of the family, for example, through
the strong religious sanctions and values implied in the marriage
ceremony and relationship (especially the marriage sacrament of the
Catholic Church), comes to be strongly fortified and entrenched.
Change in the form of an institution so hallowed by religion is
something more than change; it is sacrilege. Governments and dynasties,
again, when they have a religious sanction, when the King rules by
"divine right," acquire a strong additional source of persistence
and power. The imperial character of the Japanese government to-day,
for example, is said to be greatly enhanced in prestige by the
widespread popular belief that the Emperor is lineally descended
from divinity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sometimes religious sanctions have inspired and promoted <a
name="page_327"><span class="page">Page 327</span></a> zeal for
social enterprise. The Crusades stand out as classic instances, but
in the name of religion men have done more than build cathedrals
and go on pilgrimages. In the Middle Ages, bridges and roads were
constructed, alms were given, pictures were painted, books illuminated,
encyclop&aelig;dias made, education conducted, all under the auspices
and inspiration of the Church. The medi&aelig;val universities
started as church schools. In our own day, the expansion of the
churches in the direction of welfare work and social reform, the
use of the church as a community center, are examples of this
development. Men have found justification by good works as well
as faith.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Intolerance and inquisition.</b> The influence of religious
tradition over the minds of its followers has had, among many noble
and beautiful consequences, the dark fruits of intolerance, persecution,
inquisition, and torture. Part of the bitter narrow-mindedness which
has characterized the history of ecclesiastical institutions is not to
be attributed specifically to religion. It is rather to be explained
by the general uneasiness which the gregarious human creature feels
at any deviation from the accustomed. In addition men have felt
frequently that any divergence from the divinely ordained would
bring destruction upon the whole group. In the Christian tradition
there was an additional reason for intolerance: the heretic was
willfully losing his own soul, and it was only humane to compel
him to come "into the fold, to rescue him from the pains he would
otherwise suffer in Hell."
</p>

<p class="include">
The profound conviction that those who did not believe in its doctrines
would be damned eternally, and that God punishes theological error as
if it were the most heinous of crimes, led naturally to persecution.
It was a duty to impose on men the only true doctrine, seeing that
their own eternal interests were at stake, and to hinder errors
from spreading. Heretics were more than ordinary criminals, and
the pains that man could inflict on them were as nothing to the
tortures awaiting them in hell.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bury: <i>History of Freedom of Thought</i>, pp. 52-53.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_328"><span class="page">Page 328</span></a> In fevered
zeal for the Faith began that long hunting and punishment of heresy,
which has done so much to darken the history of religion in Western
Europe. There were, as in the Albigensian Crusade, wholesale burnings
and hangings of men, women, and children.[1] Heresy was hunted out in
secret retreats. "It was the foulest of crimes; to prevail against
it was to prevail against the legions of Hell." The culmination of
intolerance was, of course, the Inquisition. One need not pause to
recall its espionage system, its search for the spreaders of false
doctrine, its use of any and every witness against the suspect,
its granting of indulgences to any one who should bear witness
against him, its "relaxing of the criminal to the secular arm,"
which unfailingly punished him with death. It must be pointed out
that in the instance of the Inquisition, just as in the case of
all religious persecution, the motives were most frequently of
the noblest. "In the Middle Ages and after, men of kindly temper
and the purest zeal were absolutely devoid of mercy when heresy
was suspected." Nor are intolerance and persecution to be laid
exclusively at the door of any one religion. In Protestant countries,
in England and Scotland, the persecution and torture of alleged
witches is one of the most painful instances of the cruelties into
which men can be led by loyalty to their religious convictions.
And Mohammedanism vividly taught men how a faith might be spread
by fire and sword.

<p class="indent">
<b>Quietism and consolation&mdash;Other-worldliness.</b> Many religions,
including Christianity, have emphasized "other-worldliness." This has
most frequently taken the form of emphasis on the life to come. This
world has been conceived, as it were, as a prelude to eternity. In
the Christian world scheme, as most clearly expounded and universally
accepted during the Middle Ages, man's chief imperative business was
salvation. All else was trivial in comparison with that incomparable
eternal bliss which would be the reward of the virtuous, and that
unending agony which would be the penalty <a name="page_329"><span
class="page">Page 329</span></a> for the damned. "Salvation was
the master Christian motive. The Gospel of Christ was a gospel
of salvation unto eternal life. It presented itself in the
self-sacrifice of divine love, not without warnings touching its
rejection."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: H. O. Taylor: <i>Medi&oelig;val Mind</i>, vol. I, p. 61.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where interest is centered on a world to come, there not infrequently
results a loss of interest and discrimination in the goods of earthly
life. "For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?" The beauties, goods, and distinctions
of this world coalesce into an indiscriminate triviality in comparison
with that infinite glory hereafter to be attained. One does not
trouble one's self about the furniture of earthly life any more
than one would take pains with the beautification of a room in
which one happens to be lodged for a night.
</p>

<p class="include">

<p class="indent">
Though on earth you may live in squalor, poverty, and disease, yet

<p class="indent">
Poverty, indeed, became in the Middle Ages one of the vows of monastic
orders. In the New Testament it is prescribed, "Blessed are the poor
in spirit" and the doctrine was in many cases literally accepted.
</p>

<p class="include">
If any one of you will know whether he is really poor in spirit,
let him consider whether he loves the ordinary consequences and
effects of poverty, which are hunger, thirst, cold, fatigue, and
the denudation of all conveniences. See if you are glad to wear a
worn-out habit full of patches. See if you are glad when something
is lacking to your meal, when you are passed by in serving it,
when what you receive is distasteful to you, when your cell is
out of repair. If you are not glad of these things, if instead
of loving them you avoid them, then there is proof that you have
not attained the perfection of poverty of spirit.[2]

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_330"><span class="page">Page 330</span></a> Contempt
for this world's goods, when generalized, promotes an attitude
of indifference to the social conditions in which men live. The
history of the saints is filled with references to their endurance
of pain, ill health, poverty, and disease. And the "world, the
flesh, and the devil" are for some types of religious mind all
one. For such, to be engaged in social betterment is an irrelevant
business, it is to be lost in the world. People's souls must be
saved; not their bodies.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Religions, on the other hand, have frequently emphasized man's
social duty. In Christianity this is largely a derivative of the
highly regarded virtue of Charity. Interest in one's own well-being
was a prerequisite for the devout, but interest in the welfare of
others was equally enjoined. To help the poor and the needy, the
widowed and the fatherless, to bring succor to the oppressed and
justice to the downtrodden, have been part of the religion whose
Founder taught that all men were the children of their Father in
Heaven. The mendicant orders of the Middle Ages were devoted to
philanthropic works; and with religious institutions, throughout
their history, have been associated works of philanthropy and social
welfare. Very recently urban churches in this country have been
showing a tendency to reorganize with emphasis on the church as
an instrument of social co&ouml;peration rather than as an aloof
exponent of dogmatic theology. It is the ideal of some liberal
theologians to use the churches chiefly as instruments for giving
social effectiveness to the religious impulse and at the same time
for making social betterment a spiritual enterprise.

CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">ART AND THE &AElig;STHETIC EXPERIENCE</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Art <i>versus</i> nature.</b> In the Career of Reason man has
gradually learned to control the world in which he lives in the
interests of his own welfare as he imaginatively contemplated it.
Deliberate control has been made necessary because of the fact
that man is born into a world which was not made for him, but in
which he must, if anywhere, grow; in a world which was not designed
to fulfill his desires, but where alone his desires can find
fulfillment. Art may thus, in the broadest sense, be set over against
Nature. It is the activity by which man realizes ideals. He may
realize them practically, as when he builds a house which he has
first imagined, or reaps a harvest in anticipation of which he
has first sown the seeds. He may realize them imaginatively, as
when in color, form, or sound he creates some desiderated beauty
out of the crude miscellaneous materials of experience. Art, in
the broad sense of control or direction of Nature, arises in the
double fact of man's instinctive activities and desires and the
inadequacy of the environment as it stands to afford them satisfaction.
Because nature is not considerate of his needs, man must himself
take forethought, and devise means by which the forces and the
materials of Nature may be exploited to his own good. And the
realization of this forethought is made possible through the fact
that natural conditions do lend themselves to modification. Nature,
though indifferent to man's welfare, is yet partly congruous with
it. While the wind blows careless of the good or ill it does to
him, yet man may learn by means of windmills or sailboats to turn
the wind to his own interest. Though the river may flow on forever,
oblivious to the men that come and go along its shores, yet the passing
generations may transform this undeliberate <a name="page_332"><span
class="page">Page 332</span></a> flowing into the power that yields
them clothing, machinery, and transportation. All civilization is,
as Mill says, an exhibition of Art or Contrivance; it is illustrated
by
</p>

<p class="include">
the junction by bridges of shores which Nature had made separate,
the draining of Nature's marshes, the excavation of her wells,
the dragging to light of what she has buried at immense depths in
the earth; the turning away of her thunderbolts by lightning rods;
of her inundations by embankments, of her oceans by breakwaters.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Three Essays on Religion</i>, p. 19 (essay
on "Nature").]
</p>

<p class="indent">
By irrigation man has learned to make the "wilderness blossom as
the rose." By railways, telegraphs, and telephones, he has learned to
minimize the obstacles that time and space offer to the fulfillment
of his desires. By controlling, by means of education and social
organization, his own instincts in the light of the purposes he
would attain, by studying "the secret processes of Nature," man
has learned to make the world a fit habitation for himself. To dig,
to plough, to sow, to reap, are instances of the means whereby man
has applied intelligent control to his half-friendly, half-hostile
environment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Man's deliberate control of Nature arises thus under the sharp
pressure of practical necessity. Man is inherently active, but, as
pointed out in an earlier connection, his activity takes coherent
and consecutive form primarily under the compulsion of satisfying
his physical wants, of finding food, clothing, and shelter. The
greater part of human energy, certainly under primitive conditions,
is devoted to maintaining a precarious equilibrium among the mysterious
and terrifying forces of a half-understood environment. There is not
much time for leisure, play, or art, where food is a continuously
urgent problem, where one's shelter is likely to be destroyed by
storm or wind, where one is threatened incessantly by beasts of prey,
and, as primitive man supposed, by capricious supernatural powers.
Under such circumstances, life is largely spent in instrumental or
imperative pursuits. Action is fixed by necessity. It is controlled
with immediate and urgent <a name="page_333"><span class="page">Page
333</span></a> reference to the business of keeping alive. There
is scarcely time for the activity of art, which is spontaneous
and free.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In civilized life, also, the greater part of human energy must be
spent in necessary or instrumental business. Men must, as always,
be fed, clothed, and housed, and the fulfillment of these primary
human demands absorbs the greater part of the waking hours of the
majority of mankind. Our civilization is predominantly industrial;
it is devoted almost entirely to the transforming of the world of
nature into products for the gratification of the physical wants
of men. These wants have, of course, become much complicated and
refined: men wish not only to live, but to live commodiously and
well. They want not merely a roof over their heads, but a pleasant
and comfortable house in which to live. They want not merely something
to stave off starvation, but palatable foods. In the satisfaction
of these increasingly complicated demands a great diversity of
industries arises. With every new want to be fulfilled, there is
a new occupation, pursued not for its own sake, but for the sake
of the good which it produces. There are industrial leaders, of
course, who find in the development and control of the productive
energies of thousands of men, in the manipulation of immense natural
resources, satisfactions analogous to that of the fine artist. But
for most men engaged in the routine operations of industry, the
work they do is clearly not pursued on its own account. Industry,
viewed in the total context of the activities of civilization, is
a practical rather than a fine art. Its ideal is efficiency, which
means economy of effort. Its interest is primarily in producing
many goods cheaply.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The emergence of the fine arts.</b> In the sharp struggle of
man with his environment, those instincts survived which were of
practical use. The natural impulses with which a human being is
at birth endowed, are chiefly those which enable him to cope
successfully and efficiently with his environment. But even in
primitive life, so exuberant and resilient is human energy that
it is not exhausted by necessary labors. <a name="page_334"><span
class="page">Page 334</span></a> The plastic arts, for example,
began in the practical business of pottery and weaving. The weaver
and the potter who have acquired skill and who have a little more
vitality than is required for turning out something that is merely
useful, turn out something that is also beautiful. The decorations
which are made upon primitive pottery exhibit the excess vitality
and skill of the virtuoso. Similarly, religious ritual, which, as
we have seen, arises in practical commerce with the gods, comes to
be in itself cherished and beautiful. The chants which are prescribed
invocations of divinity, become songs intrinsically interesting to
singer and listener alike; the dance ceases to be merely a necessary
religious form and becomes an occasion of beauty and delight. Jane
Harrison has shown in detail how ritual arises out of practical need,
and art out of ritual.[1] Thus the Greek drama had its beginnings
in Greek religion; the incidental beauty of the choruses of the
Greek festivals developed into the eventual tragic art of
&AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Ceasing to be a practical
invocation to the gods it became an artistic enterprise in and
for itself. Repeatedly we find in primitive life that activity
is not exhausted in agriculture, hunting, and handicraft, or in
a desperate commerce with divinity. Harvest becomes a festival,
pottery becomes an opportunity for decoration, and prayer, for
poetry. Even in primitive life men find the leisure to let their
imaginations loiter over these intrinsically lovely episodes in
their experience.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The potter may be more interested in making a beautifully moulded
and decorated vessel than merely in turning out a thing of use;
the maker of baskets may come to "play with his materials," to
make baskets not so much for their usefulness as for the possible
beauty of their patterns. When this interest in beauty becomes
highly developed, and when circumstances permit, the fine arts
arise. The crafts come to be practiced as intrinsically interesting
employments of the creative imagination. The moulding of miscellaneous
materials <a name="page_335"><span class="page">Page 335</span></a>
into beautiful forms becomes a beloved habitual practice.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See Jane Harrison: <i>Ancient Art and Ritual</i>,
especially chap. I.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The context in which art appears in primitive life is paralleled in
civilized society. The energies of men are still largely consumed
in necessary pursuits. Men must, as of old, by the inadequacy of
the natural order in which they find themselves, find means by
which to live; and, being by nature constituted so that they must
live together, they must find ways of living together justly and
harmoniously. "Industry," writes Santayana, "merely gives to Nature
that form which, if more thoroughly humane, she might already have
possessed for our benefit." It is creative in so far as it transforms
matter from its crude indifferent state to forms better adapted
to human ideals. It makes cotton into cloth, wool into clothing,
wheat into flour, leather into shoes, coal into light and power,
iron into skyscrapers. It is devoted to annulling the discrepancies
between nature and human nature. It turns refractory materials
and obdurate forces into commodious goods and useful powers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But, in the broadest sense, industry is a means to an end. Interesting
and attractive it may well become, as when a bookbinder or a printer
takes a craftsman's proud delight in the manner in which he performs
his work, and in the quality of its product. But the industrial arts,
for the most part, serve more ultimate purposes. It is imaginable
that Nature might have provided clothing, food, and shelter ready
to our hand. It is questionable whether under such circumstances
men would out of deliberate choice continue industries which are
now made imperative through necessity. The mines and the stockyards
are necessary rather than beautiful or intrinsically attractive
occupations. But in the world of fact, those things which are necessary
to us are not ready to our hand. Our civilization is predominantly
industrial, and must be so, if the billion and a half inhabitants
of our world are to be maintained by the resources at our command.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nevertheless despite the absorption of a large proportion of
contemporary society in activities pursued not for their own <a
name="page_336"><span class="page">Page 336</span></a> sakes, but
for the goods which are their fruits, there is still, as it were,
energy left over. This excess vitality may, as it does for most
men, take the form of mere unorganized play or recreation. But
not so for those born with a singular gift for realizing in color
or form or sound the ideal values which they have imagined. For
these "play" is creative production. The fine arts are, in a sense,
the play of the race. They are the fruits of such energy as is,
through some fortunate accident of temperament or circumstance,
not caught up in the routine and mechanics of industry or the
trivialities of sport or pleasure. They are human activities, freed
from the limitations imposed by the exigencies of practical life, and
controlled only by the artist's imagined visions. Creative activity
is most explicit and most successful in the fine arts, because in
these there are fewer obstacles to the material realization of
imagined perfections. "The liberal arts bring to spiritual fruition
the matter which either nature or industry has prepared and rendered
propitious."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The industrial arts are, as already pointed out, man's transformation
of natural resources to ideal uses. In the same way political and
social organization are human arts, enterprises, at their best, in
the moulding of men's natures to their highest possible realization.
But in the world of action, whether political or industrial, there
are incomparably greater hindrances to the realization in practice
of imagined goods than there are, at least to the gifted, in the
fine arts. Every ideal for which men attempt to find fulfillment in
the world of action is subject to a thousand accidental deflections
of circumstance. Every enterprise involves conflicting wills; the
larger the enterprise, the more various and probably the more
conflicting the interests involved. Social movements have their
courses determined by factors altogether beyond the control of
their originators. Statesmen can start wars, but cannot define
their eventual fruits. A man may found a political party, and live
to see it wander far from the ideal which he had framed. But in
the fine arts, to the imaginatively and <a name="page_337"><span
class="page">Page 337</span></a> technically endowed, the materials
are prepared and controllable. In the hands of a master, action
does not wander from intent. Language to the poet, for example, is
an immediate and responsive instrument; he can mould it precisely
to his ideal intention. The enterprise of poetry is less dependent
almost than any other undertaking on the accidents of circumstance,
outside the poet's initial imaginative resources. In music, even so
simple an instrument as a flute can yield perfection of sound. The
composer of a symphony can invent a perpetual uncorroded beauty;
the sculptor an immortality of irrefutably persuasive form. This
explains in part why so many artists, of a reflective turn of mind,
are pessimists in practical affairs. The world of action with its
perpetual and pitiful frustrations, failures, and compromises,
seems incomparably poor, paltry, and sordid, in comparison with
the perfection that is attainable in art.

Haunting foreshadowings of the temple appear in the realm of
imagination, in music, in architecture, in the untroubled kingdom
of reason, and in the golden sunset magic of lyrics, where beauty
shines and glows, remote from the touch of sorrow, remote from
the fear of change, remote from the failures and disenchantment
of the world of fact. In the contemplation of these things the
vision of heaven will shape itself in our hearts, giving at once
a touchstone to judge the world about us, and an inspiration by
which to fashion to our needs whatever is capable of serving as
a stone in the sacred temple.[1]

The creative artist gives such form to the miscellaneous materials
at his disposal that they give satisfaction not only to the senses
or the intellect, but to the imagination. What constitute some
of the chief elements in the &aelig;sthetic experience, we shall
presently examine. It must first be pointed out that in general
in the fine arts creative genius has found ways of imaginatively
attaining perfections not usually accorded in the experiences of
the senses, in the life of society, or in the life of the mind.
</p>

<p class="include">
The region called imagination has pleasures more airy and luminous
<a name="page_338"><span class="page">Page 338</span></a> than those
of sense, more massive and rapturous than those of intelligence.
The values inherent in imagination, in instant intuition, in sense
endowed with form, are called &aelig;sthetic values; they are found
mainly in nature and in living beings, but also in man's artificial
works, in images evoked by language, and in the realm of sound.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>Reason in Art</i>, p. 15.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The painter imagines and seeks to realize hues and intensities
of color more satisfying and more suggestive than those commonly
experienced in nature, save in the occasional grace of sunset on
a mountain lake, or the miracle of moonlight on the ocean. The
artist takes his hints from nature, but clothes the suggestions
of sense with the values and motives which exist only in his own
mind and imagination. A Turner sunset is, as Oscar Wilde points
out, in a sense incomparably superior to one provided by nature.
It not only gives the beautiful sensations to be had in a landscape
suffused with the sunset glow; it infuses into this experience the
passionate and penetrating insight of a genius. The artist, to an
extent, imitates nature. But, if that were all he did, he would be
no more than a photographer. He pictures nature, but gives it "tint
and melody and breath"; he gives it a value and significance derived
from his own imaginative vision. The musician combines sounds more
significant, ordered, and rhythmical than those miscellaneous noises
which, in ordinary experience, beat indifferently or painfully upon
our ears. The poet selects words whose specific music, rhythmical
combinations, and lyrical context produce a something more evocative,
compelling, and euphonic than the casual and raucous instrument
of communication which constitutes ordinary speech.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not only do poets give imaginative and ideal extensions to sense
experience; they do as much with and for social life. In the dreaming
of Utopias, in the building of the Perfect City, men have found
compensations for the imperfect cities which have been their experiences
on earth. They build <a name="page_339"><span class="page">Page
339</span></a> themselves in imagination a world where all injustices
are erased, where beauty is perennial, where truth, courage, kindliness,
and merriment are the pervasive colors of life. In the activity of
creative art, man's imagination has reached out beyond the confines
of nature and of history, and built itself, in marble and in music,
in lyrics and in legends, hints of that enchanting possible, of
which the impoverished actual gives tentative and tenuous hints.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In some men sensitivity to the imaginative possibilities of the
materials of Nature is so high, that they can find satisfactory
activity nowhere else than in one or another of the fine arts.
These are the poets, the musicians, and the sculptors, who seek
to give realization in the arts in the technique of which they
are especially gifted, to that imagined beauty by the intimate
experience of which they live. In one way or another the creative
artist seeks to give form and dimension to
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The light that never was on sea or land,<br />
&nbsp; The consecration and the poet's dream."
</p>

<p class="indent">
This creative impulse may find its realization, as already pointed
out, in industry, though, with the highly routine character of
most men's occupations in present-day industrial life, there is
not much opportunity for imaginative activity. That both work and
happiness would be promoted by the encouragement of the craftsman
ideal goes without saying. Whether or not it is possible to utilize
the creative impulses in the processes of industry as now organized,
there are instances where the joy of craftsmanship may be exploited
both for the happiness of the worker and the good of the work. The
William Morris ideal of the artist-worker may be hard to attain,
but it is none the less desirable, both for the sake of the worker
and his work.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In science the uses of the imagination have been frequently commented
on, not least by scientists. The patient collection of facts, the
digging and measurement and inquiry that characterize so much of
scientific investigation <a name="page_340"><span class="page">Page
340</span></a> are not the whole of it. Inference, the forming
of a generalization, is frequently described "as a leap from the
known to the unknown," and this discovery of a binding principle
that brings together a wide variety of disconnected facts is not
unlike the process of the creative artist. The same unconscious
method by which a poet hits upon an appropriate epithet, a musician
upon a melody, a painter upon an effect of color or line is displayed
in that sudden vivid flash of insight by which a scientist sees
a mass of facts that have long seemed bafflingly contradictory,
gathered up under a single luminous law. In his famous essay on
"The Scientific Uses of the Imagination," Tyndall writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
We are gifted with the power of Imagination, ... and by this power
we can lighten the darkness which surrounds the world of the senses.
There are tories even in science who regard imagination as a faculty
to be feared and avoided rather than employed. They had observed its
action in weak vessels and were unduly impressed by its disasters.
But they might with equal justice point to exploded boilers as an
argument against the use of steam. Bounded and conditioned by
co&ouml;perant Reason, imagination becomes the mightiest instrument
of the physical discoverer. Newton's passage from a falling apple to
a falling moon was, at the outset, a leap of the imagination. When
William Thomson tries to place the ultimate particles of matter between
his compass points, and to apply to them a scale of millimetres, he
is powerfully aided by this faculty. And in much that has been
recently said about protoplasm and life, we have the outgoings
of the imagination guided and controlled by the known analogies
of science. In fact, without this power, our knowledge of Nature
would be a mere tabulation of coexistences and sequences. We should
still believe in the succession of day and night, of summer and
winter; but the soul of Force would be dislodged from our universe;
causal relations would disappear, and with them that science which
is now binding the parts of nature into an organic whole.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Tyndall: <i>Fragments of Science</i>, pp. 130-31.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
As we shall presently see, this imaginative leap is guarded and
controlled, so that no flash of insight, however attractive, is
uncritically accepted. But the origin of every eventually <a
name="page_341"><span class="page">Page 341</span></a> accepted
hypothesis lies in the upshoot of irresponsible fancy, differing
not at all from the images in the mind of a poet or painter or
the melodies that unpredictably occur to a musician.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The &aelig;sthetic experience.</b> Art is, on its creative side,
as we have seen, the control of Nature in the practical or imaginative
realization of ideals. The industrial arts are pursued out of necessity,
because man must find himself ways of living in a world which he
must inhabit, though it is not <i>a prior</i> arranged for his
habitation. The fine arts are pursued as ends in themselves.[1]
The genuinely gifted sing, paint, write poetry, apart from fame
and reward, for the sheer pleasure of creation. But the products
of these creative activities themselves become satisfactions on
a par with other natural goods. The objects of art&mdash;poems,
paintings, statues, symphonies&mdash;are themselves prized and
sought after. They afford satisfaction to that large number of
persons who are sensitive to the beautiful without having a gift
for its creation.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Many industrial processes exhibit elements of the
fine arts. This is the case whenever there is opportunity for the
worker to feel, and to have some ground for the feeling, that he
is not merely turning out a product, but turning out a well-made
or a beautiful one, to which his own skill is contributing. The
makers of fine books or bindings or furniture, of fine embroidery
and the like, are examples. But such conditions occur chiefly in
the so-called luxury trades. There is very little opportunity for
the display of creative talent in quantity manufacture.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the other hand, every fine art involves some elements of merely
technical skill or craftsmanship, which is important in achieving
an imaginative result, but is the skill of the mechanic rather
than the vision of the artist. In surveying the finished product
of art as it appears in a painting by a Turner or a Cezanne, we
may forget the "dust and ointment of the calling," but it is none
the less there. The drudgery of art, the practicing of scales.
the mixing of colors, the rehearsing of plays, are, as it were,
the necessary preliminary industry in art.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
&AElig;sthetic appreciation is indeed shared by all men, and is
called out by other objects than paintings or poems. There is hardly
anything men do which is not affected by what has been called "an
irrelevant access of &aelig;sthetic feeling." We saw in another
connection how our estimates of persons and situations are qualified
by love and hate, sympathy and revulsion. In the same way all our
experiences have an &aelig;sthetic coloring. <a name="page_342"><span
class="page">Page 342</span></a> It may be nothing more than the
curious jubilance and vivacity, the thrill and tingle of the blood
that comes upon a crisp autumn day. It may be, as Mill pointed
out, the largeness of thought and vision promoted by habitually
working in a spacious and dignified room. &AElig;sthetic influences
are always playing upon us; they determine not only our tastes in
the decoration of our houses, our choices of places to walk and
to eat, but even such seemingly remote and abstract matters as
a scientific theory or a philosophy of life. Even the industrial
ideal of efficiency has, "with its suggestion of Dutch neatness
and cleanliness," order and symmetry, an &aelig;sthetic flavor.
Similarly is there an appeal to our &aelig;sthetic sensibilities
in the grouping of a wide variety of facts under sweeping inclusive
and simple generalizations. There is, as has often been pointed
out, scarcely anything to choose from as regards the relative
plausibility of the Copernican over the Ptolemaic system. The former
we choose largely because of its greater symmetry and simplicity
in accounting for the facts. Even a world view may be chosen on
account of its artistic appeal. One feels moved imaginatively,
even if one disagrees with the logic of those philosophies which
see reality as one luminously transparent conscious whole, in which
every experience is delicately reticulated with every other, where
discord and division are obliterated, and the multiple variety of
mundane facts are gathered up into the symmetrical unity of the
eternal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Appreciation <i>versus</i> action.</b> Every human experience
has thus its particular and curious &aelig;sthetic flavor, as an
inevitable though undetected obligato. &AElig;sthetic values enter
into and qualify our estimates of persons and situations, and help to
determine that general sympathy or revulsion, that love or hate for
people, institutions, or ideas, which make the pervasive atmosphere
of all human action. But in the world of action, we cannot emphasize
these irrelevant &aelig;sthetic feelings. The appreciative and the
practical moods are sharply contrasted. <a name="page_343"><span
class="page">Page 343</span></a> In the latter we are interested in
results, and insist on the exclusion of all considerations that do not
bear on their accomplishment. The appreciative or &aelig;sthetic mood
is detached; it is interested not to act, but to pause and consider;
it does not want to use the present as a point of departure. It
wants to bask in the present perfection of color, word, or sound.
The practical man is interested in a present situation for what
can be done with it; he wants to know, in the vernacular, "What
comes next?" "Where do we go from here?" The appreciator wishes to
remain in the lovely interlude of perfection which he experiences
in music, poetry, or painting.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The &aelig;sthetic mood is obviously at a discount in the world of
action. To bask in the charm of a present situation, to linger and
loiter, as it were, in the sun of beauty, is to accomplish nothing,
to interrupt action. It is precisely for this reason that persons with
extremely high &aelig;sthetic sensibilities are at such a discount in
practical life. They are too easily dissolved in appreciation. They
are too much absorbed, for practical efficiency, in the tragic, the
whimsical, the beautiful, or the comic aspects of men and affairs.
The same sensitivity to the innuendoes and colors of life that enable
some of such men to give an exquisite and various portraiture of
experience, incapacitates them for action. The practical man must not
observe anything irrelevant to his immediate business. He must not
be dissolved, at every random provocation, into ecstacy, laughter,
or sorrow. There is too much to be done in business, government,
mechanics, and the laboratory, to allow one's attention to wander
dreamingly over the tragic, the beautiful, the pathetic, the comic,
and the grotesque qualities of the day's work. To take an extreme
case, it would, as Jane Harrison observes, be a monstrosity, when our
friend was drowning, to note with lingering appreciation the fluent
white curve of his arm in the glimmering waters of the late afternoon.
The man to whom every event is flooded with imaginative possibilities
and emotional suggestions is a useless or a dangerous character in
situations where it is essential to discriminate the immediate
and important bearings <a name="page_344"><span class="page">Page
344</span></a> of facts. We cannot select an expert accountant
on the basis of a pleasant smile, nor a chauffeur for his sense
of humor.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while, in the larger part of the lives of most men, observation
of facts is controlled with reference to their practical bearings,
observation may sometimes take place for its own sake. The glory
of a sunset is not commonly prized for any good that may come of
it; nobody but a general on a campaign or a fire warden looks out
from a mountain peak upon the valley below for reasons other than
the pleasure of the beholding. In the case of persons, also, we
are not always interested in them for their uses; we are sometimes
delighted with them in themselves. We pause to watch merry or quaint
children, experts at tennis, beautiful faces, for their own sakes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While even in nature and in social experience, we thus sometimes
note specifically &aelig;sthetic values, the objects of fine art
have no other justification than the immediate satisfactions they
produce in their beholder. Those intrinsic pleasures which go by
the general name of beauty are various and complicated. Our joy
may be in the sheer delight of the senses, as in the hearing of
a singularly lucid and sustained note of a clarinet, a flute, a
voice, or a violin. It may be in the appreciation of form, as in
the case of the symmetry of a temple, an arch, or an altar. It may
be in the simultaneous stirring of the senses, the imagination,
and the intellect, by the presentation of an idea suffused with
music and emotion, as in the case of an ode by Wordsworth or a
sonnet by Milton.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In all these instances we are not interested in anything beyond
the experience itself. The objects of the fine arts are not drafts
on the future, anticipations of future satisfactions eventually
to be cashed in. They are immediate and intrinsic goods, absolute
fulfillments. They are not signals to action; they are releases
from it. A painting, a poem, a symphony, do not precipitate movement
or change. They invite a restful absorption. It was this that made
Schopenhauer regard art <a name="page_345"><span class="page">Page
345</span></a> as a rest from reality. During these interludes,
at least, we live amid perfections, and are content there to move
and have our being.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Sense satisfaction.</b> Appreciation of the arts begins in the
senses. Sight and sound, these are unquestionably the chief avenues
by which the imagination is stirred.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The so-called lower senses are not regarded as yielding
&aelig;sthetic values. Smell, taste, and touch are not generally,
certainly in Occidental art, made much of.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the words of Santayana:
</p>

<p class="include">
For if nothing not once in sense is to be found in the intellect,
much less is such a thing to be found in the imagination. If the
cedars of Lebanon did not spread a grateful shade, or the winds
rustle through the maze of their branches, if Lebanon had never
been beautiful to sense, it would not now be a fit or poetic subject
of allusion.... Nor would Samarcand be anything but for the mystery
of the desert, and the picturesqueness of caravans, nor would an
argosy be poetic if the sea had no voices and no foam, the winds
and oars no resistance, and the rudder and taut sheets no pull. From
these real sensations imagination draws its life, and suggestion
its power.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Santayana: <i>Sense of Beauty</i>, p. 68.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Satisfaction in sounds arises from the regular intervals of the
vibrations of the air by which it is produced. The rapidity of
these regular beats determines the pitch. But sounds also differ
in <i>timbre</i> or quality, depending on the number of overtones
which occur in different modes of production. This explains why
a note on the scale played on the piano, differs from the same
note played on the 'cello or the organ. From these fundamental
sensuous elements of sound, elaborate symphonic compositions may be
built up, but they remain primary nevertheless. Unless the sensuous
elements of sound were themselves pleasing it is difficult to imagine
that a musical composition could be. Music would then be like an
orchestra whose members played in unison, but whose violins were
raucous and whose trumpets hoarse.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Color again illustrates the &aelig;sthetic satisfactions that are
found in certain kinds of sense stimulation, apart from the <a
name="page_346"><span class="page">Page 346</span></a> form they
are given or the emotions or ideas they express. The elements of
color, <i>as</i> color, may be reduced to three simple elements:
First may be noted <i>hue</i>, as yellow or blue; second, <i>value</i>
(or <i>notan</i>) dark or light red; and third <i>intensity</i>
(or brightness to grayness), as vivid blue or dull blue. Specific
vivid &aelig;sthetic combinations and variations are made possible
by variations or combinations of these three elements of color.
If a color scheme is displeasing, the fault may be in the wrong
selection of hues, in weak values, in ill-matched intensities or
all three.
</p>

<p class="include">
Dutch tiles, Japanese prints and blue towels, Abruzzi towels, American
blue quilts, etc., are examples of harmony built up with several
values of one hue.
</p>

<p class="include">
With two hues innumerable variations are possible. Japanese prints
of the "red and green" period are compositions in light yellow-red,
middle green, black, and white....
</p>

<p class="include">
Color varies not only in hue and value [<i>notan</i>] but in
intensity&mdash;ranging from bright to gray. Every painter knows
that a brilliant bit of color, set in grayer tones of the same
or neighboring hues, will illuminate the whole group&mdash;a
distinguished and elusive harmony. The fire opal has a single point
of intense scarlet, melting into pearl; the clear evening sky is
like this when from the sunken sun the red-orange light grades
away through yellow and green to steel gray.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dow: <i>Composition</i>, p. 109.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
These variations in hue, value, and intensity of color afford specific
&aelig;sthetic satisfactions. The blueness of the sky is its specific
beauty; the greenness of foliage in springtime is its characteristic
and quite essential charm. Apart from anything else, sensations
themselves afford satisfaction or the reverse. A loud color, a
strident or a shrill sound may cause a genuine revulsion of feeling.
A soft hue or a pellucid note may be an intrinsic pleasure, though
a formless one, and one expressive of no meaning at all.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Form.</b> While the imagination is stirred most directly by
the immediate material beauty, by the satisfaction of the senses,
beauty of form is an important element in the enhancement of
appreciation. In the plastic arts and in music, <a name="page_347"><span
class="page">Page 347</span></a> it is, next to the immediate appeal
of the sensuous elements involved, the chief ingredient in the
effects produced. And even in those arts which are notable for
their expressive values, poetry, fiction, drama and painting, the
appeal of form, as in the plot of a drama, or the structure of
an ode or it sonnet is still very high. Certain dispositions of
line and color in painting; of harmony and counterpoint in music;
rhythm, refrain, and recurrence in poetry; symmetry and balance in
sculpture; all have their specific appeal, apart from the materials
used or the emotions or ideas expressed. Certain harmonic relations
are interesting in music apart from the particular range of notes
employed, or the particular melody upon which variations are made.
The pattern of a tapestry may be interesting, apart from the color
combinations involved. The structure of a ballade or a sonnet may be
beautiful, apart from the melody of the words or the persuasiveness
of the emotion or idea. Out of the factors which enter into the
appreciation of form certain elements stand out.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is, in the first place, <i>symmetry</i>, the charm of which
lies partly in recognition and rhythm. "When the eye runs over
a fa&ccedil;ade, and finds the objects that attract it at equal
intervals, an expectation, like the anticipation of an inevitable
note or requisite word, arises in the mind, and its non-satisfaction
involves a shock."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>The Sense of Beauty</i>, p. 92.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Similarly, form given to material brings a variety of details under
a comprehensive unity, enabling us to have at once the stimulation
of diversity and the clarification of a guiding principle. We cherish
sensations in themselves, when they consist of elements like limpidness
of color and lucidity of sound. But too much miscellany of sensation
is disquieting; it has an effect analogous to noise. A baby or a
barbarian may delight in loud heterogeneity and vivid confusion,
but extravagance of sensation does not constitute an &aelig;sthetic
experience.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discovery of the one in the many, the immediate apprehension
<a name="page_348"><span class="page">Page 348</span></a> of the
fluent tracing of a pattern, a form, or a structure, is intrinsically
delightful. The pattern of a tapestry design is as striking and
suggestive as the colors themselves. When musical taste has passed
from a sentimental intoxication with the sensuous beauty of the
sounds themselves, the beauty we admire is primarily beauty of form
or structure. The musical connoisseur likes to trace the recurrence
of a theme in a symphony, its deviations and disappearances, its
distribution in the various choirs of wood-wind, brass, and strings,
its interweaving with other themes, its resilient, surprising,
and apposite emergences, its pervasive penetration of the total
scheme.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The &aelig;sthetic experience, indeed, as specifically &aelig;sthetic,
rather than merely sensuous or intellectual, is, it might be said,
almost wholly a matter of form. It is the artist's function, as it
is occasionally his achievement, to give satisfying, determinate
forms to the indeterminate and miscellaneous materials at his command.
Formlessness is for the creator of beauty the unpardonable sin. To
give clarity and coherence to the vague ambiguous scintillations
of sound, to chisel a specific perfection out of the indefinite
inviting possibilities of marble, to form precise and consecutive
suggestions out of the random and uncertain music of words, is to
achieve, in so far, success in art. Nor does form mean formality.
Experience is so various and fertile, and so far outruns the types
under which human invention and imagination can apprehend it, that
inexhaustible novelty is possible. Novelty, on the other hand, does
not mean formlessness. The artist must, if he is to be successful,
always remain something of an artisan. However beautiful his vision,
he must have sufficient command of the technical resources to his
craft to give a specific and determinate embodiment to his ideal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every one has haunting premonitions of beauty; it is the business of
the artist to give realization in form to the hints of the beautiful
which are present in matter as we meet it in experience, and to
the imaginative longings which they provoke.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_349"><span class="page">Page 349</span></a> In which
forms different individuals will find satisfaction depends on all
the circumstances which go to make one individual different from
another. There cannot be in the case of art, any more than in any
other experience, absolute standards. We can be pleased only with
those arrangements of sound or color to which our sensibilities
have early been educated. Even the most catholic of tastes becomes
restricted in the course of education. To Western ears, there is
at first no music at all in Chinese music, and Beethoven would
appear to the Chinese as barbarous as their compositions appear
to us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But while in a wide sense, conformity to the average determines
or limits our possible appreciation of the beautiful, within these
limits certain elements are intrinsically more pleasing than others.
Those elements of experience, in the first place, more readily acquire
&aelig;sthetic values, which in themselves strikingly impress the
senses. Thus tallness in a man, because it is in the first place
striking, becomes readily incorporated into our standard of the
beautiful. And all elements in themselves beautiful, the human eye,
the curve of the arm, the wave of the hair, come to be emphasized.
These outstanding elements may themselves become conventionalized and
standardized, so that objects of art which conform to them are insured
thereby of a certain degree of recognition as beautiful. Too close
a conformity produces monotonous formalities, cloying classicisms.
Too wide a divergence results in shock and unpleasantness. The
history of all the arts, however, is full of instances of how the
taste of a people can be educated to new forms. Ruskin had to educate
the English people to an appreciation of Turner. The poets of the
Romantic period were condemned by the critics brought up on the
rigid classic models. The so-called Romantic movements in the arts
are, at their best, departures from old forms, not into formlessness,
but into new, various, and more fruitful forms. Romanticism at its
worst dissolves into mere formlessness and inarticulate ecstacies.
Infinite variety of forms the world of experience may be made to
wear, but sensations, <a name="page_350"><span class="page">Page
350</span></a> emotions, and ideas must be given some form, if
they are to pass from a fruitless yearning after beauty into its
positive incarnation in objects of art.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All forms have their characteristic emotional effects, as have all
materials, even apart from the emotions or ideas they express. The
glitter of gold and the sparkle of diamonds, the strength of marble,
the sturdiness of oak&mdash;we hardly can think of these materials
without thinking of the associations which go with them. Similarly
the symmetry of the colonnades of a temple, the multiplicity and
variety of Gothic architecture, even so simple a form as a circle,
provoke a great or slight characteristic emotional reaction. Likewise,
a staccato or a fluent rhythm in music, a march, or a dance movement,
have, even apart from their unconscious or intentional expressiveness,
specific emotional values. In literature, also, where the value of
the words themselves might be expected to give place entirely to
the emotions or ideas of which they are the expressive instruments,
poems may themselves, by their form and music, be provocative of
specific emotional effects.

Here the effect lies partly in the form, but more especially in
the <i>timbre</i> and reverberation of the words themselves. In
other cases, it is the form that is the chief ingredient in the
effect produced. In Alfred Noyes's "The Barrel Organ," apart from
the meaning, it is the rhythmic form that is of chief &aelig;sthetic
value:

<b>Expression.</b> The objects of art, as we have seen, are interesting
and attractive in themselves, for the material of which they are
formed, and for the form which the artist has given them. But they
are interesting in another and possibly as important a way: they
are instruments of expression. That is, a painting is something
more than an intrinsically interesting disposition of line and
color, a statue something more than an exquisite or sublime chiseling
of marble, a poem more than a rhythmic combination of the music of
words. All of these are expressive. Something in their form is
associated with something in our past experience. Thus, as James
somewhere suggests, "a bare figure by Michelangelo, with unduly
flexed joints, may come somehow to suggest the moral tragedy of
life." Something in the face of an old man painted by Rembrandt
may recall to us a similar outward evidence of inner seriousness,
wistfulness, and resignation which we have ourselves beheld in
living people. And we clearly value the poems of a Wordsworth,
a Milton, a Matthew <a name="page_352"><span class="page">Page
352</span></a> Arnold, not solely for the magnificent form and music
of their words, but also for the sober beauty of their meaning.
We may come to appreciate even the highly immediate sensuous and
formal pleasure of music for the reverie or rapture into which by
suggestion it throws us. "Expression may, therefore, make beautiful
by suggestion, things in themselves indifferent, or it may come to
heighten the beauty which they already possess."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The objects of art may be appreciated chiefly either for their
material and form, or for the values which they express. In some
cases the actual object may be beautiful; sometimes the beauty may
lie almost wholly in the image, emotion, or idea evoked. "Home,
Sweet Home," for example, may be plausibly held to win admiration
rather for the sentimental associations which it evokes in the singer
or hearer than for its verbal or melodic beauty. The enjoyment which
people without any musical gifts, out on a camping or canoeing
trip, experience from singing a rather cheap and frayed repertory
is obviously for sentimental rather than for &aelig;sthetic
satisfaction. Similarly, we may cherish the mementos of a lost friend
or child, not for their intrinsic worth, but for the tenderness of
the memories they arouse. The situation is delicately described
in Eugene Field's "Little Boy Blue":
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The little toy dog is covered with dust,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But sturdy and staunch he stands,<br />
&nbsp; And the little toy soldier is red with rust,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his musket moulds in his hands.<br />
&nbsp; Time was when the little toy dog was new,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the soldier was passing fair,<br />
&nbsp; And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kissed them and put them there."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some objects of art may indeed become beautiful almost completely
through their expressiveness. There are certain poets whose music
is raucous and who make little appeal through clarity of form.
These survive almost completely by virtue of the persistent strength
and enduring sublimity of the ideas which they express. Much of
Whitman may be put in <a name="page_353"><span class="page">Page
353</span></a> this class, and also much of Browning. Similarly a
sculptor may not captivate us by the fluent beauty of his marble,
but by the power and passion which his crude mighty figures express.
In such cases we may even come to regard what, from a purely formal
point of view, is unlovely, as a thing of the most extreme beauty.
Even the roughness in such direct revelations of strength, may come
to be regarded as elements of the beautiful. And where massiveness of
effect does not suffice to retrieve a work of art from its essential
crudities, we may still come to accept it as beautiful, as it were,
in intention, and for what comes to be regarded as its essence,
namely, the idea or emotion it expresses. We forgive the imperfections
of form as we forgive the stammerings and stutterings of persons
whose broken sayings are yet full of wisdom.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Usually even where the object, emotion, or idea expressed is beautiful,
we demand certain formal and material elements of beauty. A telegram
may convey the very apex of felicity, yet be not at all felicitous
in its form or in the music of its words. If in such cases, we
speak of beauty, the term is altogether metaphorical and imputed;
we are using it in the same analogical sense as when we speak of a
"beautiful operation" or a "beautiful deed"; it is a moral rather
than an &aelig;sthetic term. We may find the letter of a friend
expressive of the gentleness, fidelity, and charm that have endeared
him to us, but unless these have attained sufficiently clear and
explicit form and determinate unmistakable music, the letter will
have a meaningful beauty only in the light of the peculiar relation
existing between us and the writer. From an impartial &aelig;sthetic
point of view, the epistle can only by affectionate exaggeration
be called beautiful.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the arts, through their beauty of form, may present pleasingly
objects, emotions, ideas, not in themselves beautiful or pleasing.
The clearest case of this kind is tragedy, where we may enjoy at
arm's length and through the medium of art, experiences which would
in the near actualities of life be only unmitigated horror. Refracted
through the medium of <a name="page_354"><span class="page">Page
354</span></a> poetry and drama, they may appear beautiful pervasively
and long.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are enabled through the arts to survey sympathetically universal
emotions, those by which our own lives have been touched, or to
which they are liable; we are enabled to survey bitterness and
frustration calmly because they are set in a perspective, a beautiful
perspective, in which they shine out clear and persuasive, purified
of that bitter personal tang which makes sorrow in real life so
different in tone from the beauty with which in tragedy it is halved.
Any sensation, as Max Eastman justly remarks in his "Enjoyment of
Poetry," may, if sufficiently mild, become pleasing. And there
is hardly any human action or experience, however terrible, which
cannot in the hands of a master be made appealing and sublime in
its emotional effect.
</p>

<p class="include">
The beauty of Tragedy does but make visible a quality which, in
more or less obvious shapes, is present always and everywhere in
life. In the spectacle of death, in the endurance of intolerable
pain, and in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a
sacredness, an overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the
depth, the inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some
strange marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by
bonds of sorrow. In these moments of insight we lose all eagerness
of temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends,
all care for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view,
make up the common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the
narrow raft, illumined by the flickering light of human comradeship,
the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
But emotions and experiences that in real life are displeasing
can be made pleasing in art chiefly by virtue of the qualities of
material and form already discussed. The disappointment, disillusion,
or terror which tragedy so vividly reveals is made tolerable chiefly
through the intrinsic beauty of the vehicle in which it is set
forth. The high and breathless beauty of rhythm, the verve, the
mystery, and music with which evils are set forth, may make them not
only tolerable but tender <a name="page_355"><span class="page">Page
355</span></a> and appealing. What would be as immediate experience
altogether heartrending, for example the torturing remorse of a
Macbeth, is made splendid and moving in the incisive majesty and
penetration of his monologues. At the end of Hamlet, the utter
wreck, unreason, and confusion is made bearable and beautiful by
the tender finality of Hamlet's dying words to Horatio:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Absent thee from felicity awhile<br />
&nbsp; And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br />
&nbsp; To tell my story."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Greek tragedy had the additional accouterments of a chorus, of
music, of production in a vast amphitheater to give an atmosphere of
outward grandeur to the glory of its intent. Tragedy often relieves
the net horror which is its burden by the pomp and circumstance of
the associations it suggests:
</p>

<p class="include">
We have palaces for our scene, rank, beauty, and virtues in our
heroes, nobility in their passions and in their fate, and altogether
a sort of glorification of life without which tragedy would lose
both in depth of pathos&mdash;since things so precious are
destroyed&mdash;and in subtlety of charm, since things so precious
are manifested.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>Sense of Beauty</i>, p. 228.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Tragedy still more subtly attains the beauty of expressiveness
by making the very evils and confusions and terrors it presents
somehow the exemplifications of a serene eternal order. The function
of the chorus in Greek tragedy was indeed chiefly to indicate in
solemn strophe and antistrophe the ordered and harmonious verities
of which these particular follies and frustrations were so tender and
terrible an illustration. They catch up the present and particular
evil into the calm and splendid interplay of cosmic forces. Thus
at the end of Euripides's play <i>Medea</i>, when the heroine has
slain the children she has borne to Jason and in her fury refuses to
let him gather up their dead bodies, when Jason in utter inconsolable
despair, casts himself upon the earth, out of all this wrack and
torture the chorus raises the audience into a <a name="page_356"><span
class="page">Page 356</span></a> contemplation of the ordered eternity
by which these things come to be. It sings:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Great treasure halls hath Zeus in Heaven,<br />
&nbsp; From whence to man strange dooms be given,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Past hope or fear;<br />
&nbsp; And the end men looked for cometh not,<br />
&nbsp; And a path is there where no man thought:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So hath it fallen here."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Euripides: <i>Medea</i> (Gilbert Murray translation).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Art as vicarious experience.</b> The drama, art, and painting
are, in general, ways by which we can vicariously experience the
emotions of others. All of the expressive arts are made possible by
the fundamental psychological fact that human beings give certain
instinctive and habitual signs of emotion and instinctively respond
to them. In consequence, through art experience may be immeasurably
broadened, deepened, and mellowed. Through the medium of art, modes
of life long past away can leave their imperishable and living
mementos. Dante opens to the citizen of the twentieth century the
mind and imagination of the Middle Ages. A Grecian urn can arouse,
at least to a Keats, the whole stilled magic of the Greek spirit.
And not only can we live through the life and emotion of times
long dead, but the fiction and drama and poetry of our own day
permit us to enter into realms of experience which in extent and
variety would not be possible to one man. Indeed, the possibility
of vicariously enlarging experience is one of the chief appeals of
art. We cannot all be rovers, but we can have in reading Masefield
a pungent sense of romantic open spaces, the salt winds, the perilous
motion or the broad calm of the sea. We feel something of the same
urgency as that of the author when we read:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"I must go down to the seas again, the lonely sea and the sky,<br />
&nbsp; And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br />
&nbsp; And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's
  shaking,<br />
&nbsp; And a gray mist on the sea's face and a gray dawn breaking."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Masefield: <i>Sea-Fever</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Art opens up wide avenues of possibility; it releases us from the
limitations to which a particular mode of life, an accidental <a
name="page_357"><span class="page">Page 357</span></a> niche in a
business or profession has committed us. It enables us vividly to
experience and sympathetically to appreciate the lives which are
led by other men, and in which something in our own personalities
could have found fulfillment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While the objects of art thus broaden our experience by their precise
and contagious communication of emotion, they may also express
ideas. Thus a play may have a message, a poem a vision, a painting
an allegory. Art is both at an advantage and at a disadvantage in
the communication of ideas. Ideas, if they are to be accurately
conveyed, should be devoid of emotional flourish, and presented
with telegraphic directness and precision. They should have the
clarity of formulas, rather than the distracting array and atmosphere
of form. But ideas presented in the persuasive garb of beauty,
gain in their hold over men what they lose in precision. Thus an
eloquent orator, a touching letter, a vivid poem, may do more than
volumes of the most definitive and convincing logic to insinuate
an idea into men's minds. Compare in effectiveness the most
thoroughgoing treatise on the status of the agricultural laborer
with the stirring momentum of Edwin Markham's" The Man With the
Hoe":
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans<br />
&nbsp; Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,<br />
&nbsp; The emptiness of ages in his face,<br />
&nbsp; And on his back the burden of the world.<br />
&nbsp; Who made him dead to rapture and despair,<br />
&nbsp; A thing that grieves not, and that never hopes,<br />
&nbsp; Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?<br />
&nbsp; Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?<br />
&nbsp; Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow?<br />
&nbsp; Whose breath blew out the light within this brain?
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Is this the Thing the Lord God made and gave<br />
&nbsp; To have dominion over sea and land;<br />
&nbsp; To trace the stars and search the heavens for power,<br />
&nbsp; To feel the passion of Eternity?<br />
&nbsp; Is this the Dream he dreamed who shaped the suns,<br />
&nbsp; And marked their ways upon the ancient deep?<br />
&nbsp; Down all the stretch of Hell to its last gulf
<a name="page_358"><span class="page">Page 358</span></a><br />
&nbsp; There is no shape more terrible than this&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; More tongued with censure of the world's blind greed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; More filled with signs and portents for the soul&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; More fraught with menace to the universe."
</p>

<p class="indent">
An idea clothed with such music and passion is an incomparably
effective means of arousing a response. It is this which makes
art so valuable an instrument of propaganda. People will respond
actively to ideas set forth with fervor by a Tolstoy or an Ibsen
who would be left cold by the flat and erudite accuracy of a volume
on economics. And the confirmed Platonist is made so perhaps less
by the convincingness of Plato's logic, than by the inevitable
and irrefutable grace of his dramatic art.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is, for certain persons educated in the arts, a satisfaction
that is neither sensuous nor emotional, but intellectual. These
come to discriminate form with the abstract though warm interest
of the expert. The well-informed concert-goer begins to appreciate
beauties hidden to the uninitiate. He notes with eager anticipation
the technical genius of a composition as it unfolds, admiring the
craft and skill as well as the vision of the artist. In extreme
cases this may, of course, degenerate into mere pedantry. But at
its best, it is the satisfaction of the man who, having a keen eye
for beauty, is all the more solicitous for its accurate realization.
The satisfactions of the connoisseur are merely a refinement of
less sophisticated forms of appreciation. To appreciate the bare
sounds of music, or the vividness of color in a painting is the
prelude to more discriminating tastes. It is impossible for most
men to have in all the arts expert judgment, but the ability to
be able to discriminate with authority the technical achievements
of a work of genius, while it does not supplant the emotional and
sense satisfaction derived from the arts, nevertheless enhances
them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Art and &aelig;sthetic experience in the social order.</b> The
creative activity which is, to a peculiar extent, the artist's,
is sought and practiced to some degree by all men. Genius <a
name="page_359"><span class="page">Page 359</span></a> is rare,
but talent of a minor sort is frequent. In the playing of a musical
instrument, in the practice of a handicraft, in the cultivation
of a garden, ordinary men in modern society find an outlet for
invention, craftsmanship, and imagination. To give this joy of
creation, in smaller or larger measure, to all men is to promote
social happiness. In the discussion of instinct it was pointed
out that men come nearest to attaining happiness when they are
doing what is their bent by original nature, when they are acting
out of sheer love of the activity rather than from compulsion. And
since all men possess, although in moderate degree, the creative
impulse, to give this impulse a chance is a distinct social good.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The employment of the creative imagination demands both leisure
and training. Leisure is needed because, in the routine activities
of industry, men's actions are determined not by their imagination,
but by the immediacies of practical demands. There may be, as Helen
Marot suggests, a possibility of a wide utilization of the creative
impulse in industry. But a large part of industrial life must of
necessity remain routine. In consequence, during their leisure
hours alone, can men find free scope for some form of &aelig;sthetic
interest and activity. The second requisite is training. Even the
poor player of an instrument can derive some pleasure from his
performance. And, under the accidents of economic and social
circumstance, many a flower may really be born to blush unseen through
the fact that its talents receive no opportunity. The occasional
"discovery" by a wealthy man of a genius in the slums, indicates
how a more liberal and general provision of training in the arts
might redound to the general good. And a more widespread endowment
of training in the fine arts, if it did not produce many geniuses,
might at least produce a number of competent painters and musicians,
who, in the practice of their skill, during their leisure, would
derive considerable and altogether wholesome pleasure.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While high &aelig;sthetic capacity may be lacking in most people,
&aelig;sthetic appreciation is widely diffused, and the education
of <a name="page_360"><span class="page">Page 360</span></a> taste
and the growth in appreciation of the arts have been marked. The
museums of art in our large cities report a constantly increasing
attendance, both of visitors to the galleries and attendants at
lectures. And the crowds which regularly attend musical programs
of a sustainedly high character in many cities, winter and summer,
are evidence of how widespread and eager is appreciation of the
fine arts. In the Scandinavian countries and in Germany one of the
most remarkable social phenomena has been the growth of a widely
supported people's theater movement, in which there has been consistent
support of the highest type of operas and plays.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Art as an industry.</b> The fact that objects of art are themselves
immediate satisfactions and supply human wants, makes their provision
for large numbers an important social enterprise. Certain forms of
art, therefore, become highly industrialized. The provision of the
objects of art becomes a profitable business, as it is also made
possible only by a large economic outlay. Tolstoy in his <i>What
is Art?</i> brings out strikingly the economic basis of artistic
enterprises in contemporary society:
</p>

<p class="include">
For the support of art in Russia [1898], the government grants
millions of roubles in subsidies to academies, conservatories,
and theatres. In France, twenty million francs are assigned for
art, and similar grants are made in Germany and England.
</p>

<p class="include">
In every large town enormous buildings are erected for museums,
academies, conservatories, dramatic schools, and for performances
and concerts. Hundreds of thousands of workmen&mdash;carpenters,
masons, painters, joiners, paperhangers, tailors, hairdressers,
jewelers, molders, type-setters&mdash;spend their whole lives in
hard labor to satisfy the demands of art, so that hardly any other
department of human activity, except the military, consumes so
much energy as this.
</p>

<p class="include">
Not only is enormous labor spent on this activity, but in it, as
in war, the very lives of men are sacrificed. Hundreds of thousands
of people devote their lives from childhood to learning to twirl
their legs rapidly (dancers), or to touch notes and strings very
rapidly (musicians) or to turn every phrase inside out and find
a rhyme for every word.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Tolstoy: <i>What is Art?</i> pp. 1-2 (written in 1898).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_361"><span class="page">Page 361</span></a> Tolstoy's
point in thus emphasizing the immense energies devoted to artistic
enterprises is to lead us to consider what is the end of all this
labor. He points out scathingly the ugliness, frivolity, and crudity
of much that passes for drama in the theater, for music in the
concert hall, and for literature between covers. He pleads for a
simple art that shall express with sincerity the genuine emotions
of the great mass of men.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Whatever be our estimate of Tolstoy's sweeping condemnation of so
much of what has come to be regarded as classic beauty, the point
he makes about the commercialization of art is incontrovertible. If
art is an industry, the good is determined, as it were, by popular
vote. The many must be pleased rather than the discriminating.
While, as has been noted, &aelig;sthetic appreciation is fairly
general, appreciation of the subtler forms of art requires training.
The glaring, the conspicuous, the broad effect, is more likely to
win rapid popular approval than the subtle, the quiet, and the
fragile. That taste is readily educable is true. But when immediate
profits are the end, one cannot pause to educate the public. And
publishing and the theater are two conspicuous instances of the
conflicts that not infrequently arise between standards of economic
return and standards of &aelig;sthetic merit. Even where there
is no deliberate selection of the worse rather than the better,
commercial standards operate to put the novel in art at a discount.
As already pointed out, we tend to appreciate forms and ideas to
which we are accustomed. In consequence, where commercial demands
make immediate widespread appreciation necessary, the untried,
the odd, the radical innovation in music, literature, or drama,
is a questionable venture. There are notable instances of works
which, though eventually recognized as great, had to go begging
at first for a publisher or a producer. This was the case with
some of Meredith's earlier novels; later Meredith, as a publisher's
reader, turned down some of Shaw. The same inhospitality met some
of the plays of Ibsen and some of the symphonies of Tschaikowsky.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_362"><span class="page">Page 362</span></a> <b>Art
and morals.</b> Attention has already been called to the fact that
objects of art are powerful vehicles for social propaganda. Indeed
some works become famous less for their intrinsic beauty than for
their moral force.[1] The effectiveness of art forms as instruments
of propaganda lies in the fact, previously noted, that the ideas
presented, with all the accouterments of color, form, and movement,
are incomparably effective in stimulating passion; ideas thus aroused
in the beholder have the vivid momentum of emotion to sustain them.
There is only rhetorical exaggeration in the saying, "Let me sing
a country's songs, and I care not who makes its laws." Plato was
one of the first to recognize how influential art could be in
influencing men's actions and attitudes. So keenly did he realize
its possible influence, that in constructing his ideal state he
provided for the rigid regulation of all artistic production by
the governing power, and the exile of all poets. He felt deeply how
insinuatingly persuasive poets could become with their dangerous
"beautiful lies." Artists have, indeed, not infrequently been
revolutionaries, at least in the sense that the world which they
so ecstatically pictured makes even the best of actual worlds look
pale and paltry in comparison. The imaginative genius has naturally
enough been discontented with an existing order that could not possibly
measure up to his ardent specifications. Shelley is possibly the
supreme example of the type; against his incorrigible construction
of perfect worlds in imagination he set the real world in which
men live, and found it hateful.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: The classic instance of a work that certainly was
notable in its early history for its propaganda value is <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin</i>. An extreme instance of a book famous almost exclusively
for its vivid propaganda is Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In consequence of this discontent which the imaginative artist
so often expresses with the real world, and the power of his
enthusiastic visions to win the loyalties and affections of men,
many moralists and statesmen have, like Plato, regarded the creative
artist with suspicion. They have half believed the lyric boast of
the Celtic poet who wrote:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
<a name="page_363"><span class="page">Page 363</span></a>
"One man with a dream at pleasure,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall go forth and conquer a crown,<br />
&nbsp; And three with a new song's measure,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can trample an empire down.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"We, in the ages lying,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the buried past of the earth,<br />
&nbsp; Built Nineveh with our sighing,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Babel itself with our mirth;<br />
&nbsp; We o'erthrew them with prophesying<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the old of the new world's worth,<br />
&nbsp; For each age is a dream that, is dying,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or one that is coming to birth."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: O'Shaughnessy: <i>Ode to the Music-Makers</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many, therefore, who have reflected upon art&mdash;Plato first
and chiefly&mdash;have insisted that art must be used to express
only those ideas and emotions which when acted upon would have
beneficent social consequences. Only those stories are to be told,
those pictures to be painted, those songs to be sung, which contribute
to the welfare of the state. Many artists have similarly felt a
Puritanical responsibility; they have told only those tales which
could be pointed with a moral. The supreme example of this dedication
of art to a moral purpose is found in the Middle Ages, when all
beauty of architecture, painting, and much of literature and drama,
was pervaded, as it was inspired, with the Christian message. Later
Milton writes at the beginning of <i>Paradise Lost</i>:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"... What in me is dark,<br />
&nbsp; Illumine, what is low&mdash;raise and support,<br />
&nbsp; That to the height of this great argument<br />
&nbsp; I may assert Eternal Providence,<br />
&nbsp; And justify the ways of God to man."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Milton: <i>Paradise Lost</i>, book I, lines 22-26.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In a sense, the supreme achievements of creative genius have been
notable instances of the expression of great moral or religious or
social ideals. Lucretius's <i>On the Nature of Things</i> is the
noblest and most passionate extant rendering of the materialistic
conception of life. Goethe's <i>Faust</i> expresses in epic magnificence
a whole romantic philosophy <a name="page_364"><span class="page">Page
364</span></a> of endless exploration and infinite desire. Dante's
<i>Divine Comedy</i> sums up in a single magnificent epic the spirit
and meaning of the medi&aelig;val point of view. As Henry Osborn
Taylor writes of it:
</p>

<p class="include">
Yet even the poem itself was a climax long led up to. The power
of its feeling had been preparing in the conceptions, even in the
reasonings, which through the centuries had been gaining ardour
as they became part of the entire natures of men and women. Thus
had medi&aelig;val thought become emotionalized and plastic and
living in poetry and art. Otherwise, even Dante's genius could
not have fused the contents of medi&aelig;val thought into a poem.
How many passages in the <i>Commedia</i> illustrate this&mdash;like
the lovely picture of Lia moving in the flowering meadow, with her
fair hands making her a garland. The twenty-third canto of the
<i>Paradiso</i>, telling of the triumph of Christ and the Virgin,
yields a larger illustration; and within it, as a very concrete
lyric instance, floats that flower of angelic love, the song of
Gabriel circling the Lady of Heaven with its melody, and giving
quintessential utterance to the love and adoration which the Middle
Ages had intoned to the Virgin. Yes, if it be Dante's genius, it
is also the gathering emotion of the centuries, which lifts the
last cantos of the <i>Paradiso</i> from glory to glory, and makes
this closing singing of the <i>Commedia</i> such supreme poetry. Nor
is it the emotional element alone that reaches its final voice in
Dante. Passage after passage of the <i>Paradiso</i> is the apotheosis
of scholastic thought and ways of stating it, the very apotheosis,
for example, of those harnessed phrases in which the line of great
scholastics had endeavoured to put in words the universalities
of substance and accident and the absolute qualities of God.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Taylor: <i>The Medi&aelig;val Mind</i>, vol. II, pp.
588-89.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In these supreme instances the ideas have been given a genuinely
&aelig;sthetic expression. They are beautiful in form and music, as
well as in content and vision. But not infrequently where propaganda
appears, art flies out of the window. Many modern plays and novels
might be cited, which in their serious devotion to the enunciation of
some social ideal, lapse from song into statistics. The artist with
his eye on the social consequences of his work may come altogether to
cease to regard standards of beauty. It is only the rare genius who
can make <a name="page_365"><span class="page">Page 365</span></a>
poetry out of politics. Even Shelley lapses into deadly and arid
prosiness when his chief interest becomes the presentation of the
political ideas of Godwin.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In contrast with the theory that art has a social responsibility,
that so powerful an instrument must be used exclusively in the
presentation of adequate social ideals, must be set the doctrine,
widely current in the late nineteenth century, of "art for art's
sake." To the exponents of this point of view, the artist has only
one responsibility, the creation of beauty. It is his to realize
in form every pulsation of interest and desire, to provide every
possible exquisite sensation. The artist must not be a preacher;
he must not tell men what is the good; he must show them the good,
which is identical with the beautiful. And he must exhibit the
beautiful in every unique and lovely posture which can be imagined,
and which he can skillfully realize in color, in word, or in sound.
Art is its own justification; "a thing of beauty is a joy forever."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where art is governed by such intentions, form and material become
more important than expression. Thus there develops in France in the
late nineteenth century a school of Symbolists and Sensationalists in
poetry, whose single aim is the production of precise and beautiful
sensations through the specific use of evocative words. The form
and the style become everything in literature, in painting, and the
plastic arts. The emphasis is put upon exquisiteness in decoration,
upon precision in technique, upon loveliness of material. The
Pre-Raphaelite movement in poetry, with its emphasis on the use
of picturesque and decorative epithets, the exclusive emphasis
in some modern music on subtlety of technique in tone and color,
are recent examples.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The position taken has clearly this much justification. A work
does not become a work of art through the fact that it expresses
noble sentiments. The most righteous sermon may not be beautiful.
Whatever be the source of its inspiration, art must make its appeal
through the palpable and undeniable <a name="page_366"><span
class="page">Page 366</span></a> beauty of the formal embodiment
it has given to its vision. However much an object be prized as a
moral instrument, unless it stirs the senses and the imagination,
it hardly can be called a work of art. On the other hand, things
intrinsically beautiful do seem to be their own justification. A
poem of Keats, a Japanese print, a delicate vase, or an exquisite
song demand no moral justification. They are their own sufficient
excuse for being.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the "art for art's sake" doctrine, carried to extremes, results
in mere decadence or triviality. It produces at best exquisite
decorative trifles rather than works of a large and serious beauty.
Music seems to be the art where sheer beauty of form is its own
justification, for music can hardly be used as a specific medium
of communication. Those compositions that purport to be "program
music," to convey definite impressions of particular scenes or ideas,
are somewhat halting attempts to use music as one uses language.
Yet even in music, though we may enjoy ingenious and fluent melodic
trifles, we regard them less highly than the earnest and magnificent
beauty of a Beethoven symphony.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But because art is only effective when it appeals to the senses and
to the imagination does not mean that the senses and the imagination
must be stirred by insignificance. The artist may use the rhythms of
music, line and color, the suggestiveness of words, in the interests
of ideal values. Gifted, as he is, with imaginative foresight to
imagine a world better than the one in which he is living, he may,
by picturing ideals in persuasive form, not only bring them before
the mind of man, but insinuate them into his heart. The rational
artist may note the possibilities afoot in his environment. He may
treasure these hints of human happiness, and by giving them vivid
reality in the forms of art indicate captivatingly to men where
possible perfections lie. "For your young men shall see visions,
and your old men shall dream dreams." The artist may become the
most influential of prophets, for his prophecies come to men not
as arbitrary counsels, but as pictures of <a name="page_367"><span
class="page">Page 367</span></a> Perfection intrinsically lovely
and intriguing. When Socrates is asked whether or not his perfect
city exists, he replies that it exists only in Heaven, but that
men in beholding it may, in the light of that divine pattern, learn
to attain in their earthly cities a not dissimilar beauty.

CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="subtitle">SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>What science is.</b> Science may be considered either as the
product of a certain type of human activity, or as a human activity
satisfactory even apart from its fruits. As an activity, it is a
highly refined form of that process of reflection by which man
is, in the first place, enabled to make himself at home in the
world. It differs from the ordinary or common-sense process of
thinking, as we shall presently see, in being more thoroughgoing,
systematic, and sustained. It is common sense of a most extraordinarily
refined and penetrating kind. But before examining the procedure
of science, we must consider briefly its imposing product, that
science whose vast structure seems to the layman so final, imposing,
and irrefragable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the point of view of the product which is the fruit of reflective
activity, Science may be defined as <i>a body of systematized and
verified knowledge, expressing in general terms the relations of
exactly defined phenomena.</i> In all the respects here noted, science
may be contrasted with those matters of <i>common knowledge</i>, of
<i>opinion</i> or <i>belief</i> which are the fruit of our casual
daily thinking and experience. Science is, in the first place, a
body of <i>systematized</i> knowledge. One has but to contrast
the presentation of facts in an ordinary textbook in zo&ouml;logy
with the random presentation of facts in a newspaper or in casual
conversation. In science the facts bearing on a given problem are
presented as completely as possible and are classified with reference
to their significant bearings upon the problem. Moreover the facts
gathered and the classifications of relationship made are not more
or less accurate, more or less true; they are tested and verified
results. That putrefaction, for example, is due to the life of
micro-organisms in <a name="page_369"><span class="page">Page
369</span></a> the rotting substance is not a mere assumption.
It has been proved, tested, and verified by methods we shall have
occasion presently to examine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Scientific knowledge, moreover, is general knowledge. The relations
it expresses are not <i>true</i> in some cases of the precise kind
described, <i>untrue</i> in others. The relations hold true whenever
these precise phenomena occur. This generality of scientific relations
is closely connected with the fact that science expresses relations
of exactly defined phenomena. When a scientific law expresses a
certain relation between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, it says in effect:
Given <i>A</i> as meaning this particular set of conditions and no
others, and <i>B</i> as meaning this particular set of conditions
and no others, then this relation holds true. The relations between
<i>exactly</i> defined phenomena are expressed in general terms, that
is, the relations expressed hold true, given certain conditions,
whatever be the accompanying circumstances. It makes no difference
what be the kind of objects, the law of gravitation still holds
true: the attraction between objects is directly proportional to
the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus science as an activity is marked off by its method and its
intent rather than by its subject-matter. As a method it is
characterized by thoroughness, persistency, completeness, generality,
and system. As regards its intent, it is characterized by its freedom
from partiality or prejudice, and its interest in discovering what
the facts are, apart from personal expectations and desires. In
the scientific mood we wish to know what the nature of things is.
There are men who seem to have a boundless, insatiable curiosity,
who have a lifelong passion for acquiring facts and understanding
the relationship between them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Science as explanation.</b> The satisfactions which scientific
investigators derive from their inquiries are various. There is,
in the first place, the sheer pleasure of gratifying the normal
human impulse of curiosity, developed in some people to an <a
name="page_370"><span class="page">Page 370</span></a> extraordinary
degree. Experience to a sensitive and inquiring mind is full of
challenges and provocations to look further. The appearance of dew,
an eclipse of the sun, a flash of lightning, a peal of thunder, even
such commonplace phenomena as the falling of objects, or the rusting
of iron, the evaporation of water, the melting of snow, may provoke
inquiry, may suggest the question, "Why?" Experience, as it comes to
us through the senses, is broken and fragmentary. The connections
between the occurrences of Nature seem casual, and connected, as
it were, purely by accident. A black sky portends rain. But such
an inference made by the untrained mind is merely the result of
habit. A black sky has been followed by rain in the past; the same
sequence of events may be expected in the future. But the connection
between the two is not really understood. Sometimes experiences
seem to contradict each other. The straight stick looks crooked
or broken in water. The apparent anomalies and contradictions, the
welter of miscellaneous facts with which we come in contact through
the experiences of the senses, are clarified by the generalizations
of science. The world of facts ceases to be random, miscellaneous,
and incalculable. Every phenomenon that occurs is seen to be an
instance of a general law that holds among all phenomena that resemble
it in certain definable respects. Thus the apparent bending of
the stick in water is seen to be a special case of the laws of
the refraction of light; the apparent anomaly or contradiction
of our sense experiences is, as we say, explained. What seemed to
be a contradiction and an exception is seen to be a clear case
of a regular law.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The desire for explanation in some minds is very strong. Science
<i>explains</i> in the sense that <i>it reduces a phenomenon to the
terms of a general principle, whatever that principle may be.</i>
When we meet a phenomenon that seems to come under no general law,
we are confronted with a mystery and a miracle. We do not know
what to expect from it. But when we can place a phenomenon under
a general law, applicable in a wide <a name="page_371"><span
class="page">Page 371</span></a> variety of instances, everything
that can be said of all the other instances in which the law applies,
applies also to this particular case.
</p>

<p class="include">
Think of heat as motion, and whatever is true of motion will be
true of heat; but we have had a hundred experiences of motion for
everyone of heat. Think of the rays passing through this lens as
bending toward the perpendicular, and you substitute for the
comparatively unfamiliar lens the very familiar notion of a particular
change in direction of a line, of which motion every day brings us
countless examples.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: James: <i>Psychology</i>, vol. II, p. 342.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be noticed that the explanation which science gives, is
really in answer to the question, "How?" not the question, "Why?" We
are said to understand phenomena when we understand the laws which
<i>govern</i> them. But to say that certain given phenomena&mdash;the
appearance of dew, the falling of rain, the flash of lightning, the
putrefaction of animal matter&mdash;<i>obey</i> certain laws is
purely metaphorical. Phenomena do not <i>obey</i> laws in the sense
in which we say the child follows the commands of his parents, or the
soldier those of his officer. The laws of science simply describe
the relations which have repeatedly been observed to exist between
phenomena. They are laws in the sense that they are invariably
observed successions. When it has been found that whenever <i>A</i>
is present, <i>B</i> is also present, that the presence of <i>A</i>
is always correlated with the presence of <i>B</i>, and the presence
of <i>B</i> is always correlated with the presence of <i>A</i>,
we say we have discovered a scientific law.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science thus explains in the sense that it reduces the multiplicity
and variety of phenomena to simple and general laws. The ideal of
unity and simplicity is the constant ideal toward which science
moves, and its success in thus reducing the miscellaneous facts
of experience has been phenomenal. The history of science in the
nineteenth century offers some interesting examples. The discovery
of the conservation of energy and its transformations has revealed to
us the unity <a name="page_372"><span class="page">Page 372</span></a>
of force. It has shown, for example, that the phenomenon of heat
could be explained by molecular motions. "Electricity annexed
magnetism." Finally the relations of electricity and light are now
known; "the three realms of light, of electricity and of magnetism,
previously separated, form now but one; and this annexation seems
final."
</p>

<p class="indent">
There has been thus an increasing approach toward unity, toward
the summation of phenomena under one simple, general formula.[1]
Poincar&eacute;, in reviewing this progress, writes:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Poincar&eacute; notes also the opposite tendency,
for science to grow more complex. As he says: "And Newton's law
itself? Its simplicity, so long undetected, is perhaps only apparent.
Who knows whether it is not due to some complicated mechanism, to
the impact of some subtile matter animated by irregular movements,
and whether it has not become simple only through the action of
averages and of great numbers? In any case it is difficult not
to suppose that the true law contains complementary terms, which
would become sensible at small distances." (<i>Foundations of
Science</i>, p. 132.)]
</p>

<p class="include">
The better one knows the properties of matter the more one sees
continuity reign. Since the labors of Andrews and Van der Wals,
we get an idea of how the passage is made from the liquid to the
gaseous state and that this passage is not abrupt. Similarly there
is no gap between the liquid and solid states, and in the proceedings
of a recent congress is to be seen, alongside of a work on the
rigidity of liquids, a memoir on the flow of solids....
</p>

<p class="include">
Finally the methods of physics have invaded a new domain, that
of chemistry; physical chemistry is born. It is still very young,
but we already see that it will enable us to connect such phenomena
as electrolysis, osmosis, and the motions of ions.
</p>

<p class="include">
From this rapid exposition what shall we conclude?
</p>

<p class="include">
Everything considered, we have approached unity; we have not been as
quick as we had hoped fifty years ago, we have not always taken the
predicted way; but, finally, we have gained ever so much ground.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Poincar&eacute;: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 153-54.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The satisfaction which disinterested science gives to the investigator
is thus, in the first place, one of clarification. Science, by
enabling us to see the wide general laws of which all phenomena
are particular instances, emancipates the imagination. It frees us
from being bound by the accidental suggestions which come to us from
mere personal caprice, <a name="page_373"><span class="page">Page
373</span></a> habit, and environment, and enables us to observe
facts uncolored by passions and hope, and to discover those laws
of the universe which, in the words of Karl Pearson, "hold for all
normally constituted minds." In ordinary experience, our impressions
and beliefs are the results of inaccurate sense observation colored
by hope and fear, aversion and revulsion, and limited by accidental
circumstance. Through science we are enabled to detach ourselves
from the personal and the particular and to see the world, as,
undistorted, it must appear to any man anywhere:
</p>

<p class="include">
The scientific attitude of mind involves a sweeping away of all
other desires in the interests of the desire to know&mdash;it involves
suppression of hopes and fears, loves and hates, and the whole
subjective emotional life, until we become subdued to the material,
able to see it frankly, without preconceptions, without bias, without
any wish except to see it as it is, and without any belief that what
it is must be determined by some relation, positive or negative,
to what we should like it to be, or to what we can easily imagine
it to be.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bertrand Russell: <i>Mysticism and Logic</i>, p. 44.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides the satisfactions of system and clarity which the sciences
give, they afford man power and security. "Knowledge is power,"
said Francis Bacon, meaning thereby that to know the connection
between causes and effects was to be able to regulate conditions so
as to be able to produce desirable effects and eliminate undesirable
ones. Even the most disinterested inquiry may eventually produce
practical results of a highly important character. "Science is,"
as Bertrand Russell says, "to the ordinary reader of newspapers,
represented by a varying selection of sensational triumphs, such
as wireless telegraphy and aeroplanes, radio-activity, etc." But
these practical triumphs in the control of natural resources are
often casual incidents of patiently constructed systems of knowledge
which were built up without the slightest reference to their fruits
in human welfare. Wireless telegraphy, for example, was made possible
by the disinterested and abstract inquiry of three men, Faraday,
Maxwell, and Hertz.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_374"><span class="page">Page 374</span></a> In alternating
layers of experiment and theory these three men built up the modern
theory of electromagnetism, and demonstrated the identity of light
with electromagnetic waves. The system which they discovered is one
of profound intellectual interest, bringing together and unifying
an endless variety of apparently detached phenomena, and displaying
a cumulative mental power which cannot but afford delight to every
generous spirit. The mechanical details which remained to be adjusted
in order to utilize their discoveries for a practical system of
telegraphy demanded, no doubt, very considerable ingenuity, but had
not that broad sweep and that universality which could give them
intrinsic interest as an object of disinterested contemplation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Bertrand Russell: <i>Mysticism and Logic</i>, p. 34
("Science and Culture").]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Science and a world view.</b> One of the values of disinterested
science that is of considerable psychological importance is the
change in attitude it brings about in man's realization of his
place in the universe. Lucretius long ago thought to free men's
minds from terror and superstition by showing them how regular,
ordered, and inevitable was the nature of things. The superstitious
savage walks in dread among natural phenomena. He lives in a world
which he imagines to be governed by capricious and incalculable
forces. To a certain extent he can, as we have seen, control these.
But he is ill at ease. He is surrounded by vast ambiguous forces,
and moves in a trembling ignorance of what will happen next.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To those educated to the scientific point of view, there is a solidity
and assurance about the frame of things. Beneath the variability
and flux, which they continually perceive, is the changeless law
which they have learned to comprehend. Although they discover that
the processes of Nature move on indifferent to the welfare of man,
they know, nevertheless, that they are dependable and certain,
that they are fixed conditions of life which, to a certain extent,
can be controlled, and the incidental goods and ills of which are
definitely calculable. Heraclitus, the ancient Greek philosopher,
noted the eternal flux, yet perceived the steady order beneath, so
that he could eventually assert that all things changed save the
law of <a name="page_375"><span class="page">Page 375</span></a>
change. The magnificent regularity of natural processes has been
repeatedly remarked by students of science.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The &aelig;sthetic value of science.</b> As pointed out in the
chapter on Art, scientific discovery is more than a mere tabulation of
facts. It is also a work of the imagination, and gives to the worker
in the scientific field precisely the same sense of satisfaction as
that experienced by the creative artist. Of Kelvin his biographer
writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
Like Faraday and the other great masters in science, he was accustomed
to let his thoughts become so filled with the facts on which his
attention was concentrated that the relations subsisting between
the various phenomena gradually dawned upon him, and he <i>saw</i>
them, as if by some process of instinctive vision denied to others.
... His imagination was vivid; in his intense enthusiasm, he seemed
to be driven rather than to drive himself. The man was lost in
his subject, becoming as truly inspired as is the artist in the
act of creation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Sylvanus P. Thompson; <i>The Life of William Thomson,
Baron Kelvin of Largs</i>, pp. 1125 ff.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the working-out of a principle, the systematizing of many facts
under a sweeping generalization, the scientist finds a creator's
joy. He is giving form and significance to the disordered and chaotic
materials of experience. The scientific imagination differs from the
artistic imagination simply in that it is controlled with reference
to facts. The first flash is subjected to criticism, examination,
revision, and testing. But the grand generalizations of science
originate in just such an unpredictable original vision. The discovery
of the fitting formula which clarifies a mass of facts hitherto
chaotic and contradictory is very closely akin to the process by
which a poet discovers an appropriate epithet or a musician an
apposite chord.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But in its products as well as in its processes, scientific
investigations have a high &aelig;sthetic value. There is symmetry,
order, and splendor in the relations which science reveals. The same
formal beauty that appeals to us in a Greek statue or a Beethoven
symphony is to be found in the universe, but <a name="page_376"><span
class="page">Page 376</span></a> on a far more magnificent scale.
There is, in the first place, the sense of rhythm and regularity:
</p>

<p class="include">
There comes [to the scientific investigator] a sense of pervading
order. Probably this began at the very dawn of human reason&mdash;when
man first discovered the year with its magnificent object-lesson
of regularly recurrent sequences, and it has been growing ever
since. Doubtless the early forms that this perception of order
took referred to somewhat obvious uniformities; but is there any
essential difference between realizing the orderliness of moons and
tides, of seasons and migrations, and discovering Bodes's law of
the relations of the planets, or Mendel&eacute;eff's "Periodic Law"
of the relations of the atomic weights of the chemical elements?[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Thomson: <i>Introduction to Science</i>, p. 174.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Ever since Newton's day the harmony of the spheres has been a favorite
poetic metaphor. The spaciousness of the solar system has captivated
the imagination, as have the time cycles revealed by the paths
of comets and meteors. The universe seems indeed, as revealed by
science, to present that quality of &aelig;sthetic satisfaction
which is always derived from unity in multiplicity. The stars are
as innumerable as they are ordered. And it was Lucretius, the poet
of naturalism, who was wakened to wonder and admiration at the
ceaseless productivity, inventiveness, and fertility of Nature.
We find in the revelations of science again the same examples of
delicacy and fineness of structure that we admire so much in the
fine arts. The brain of an ant, as Darwin said, is perhaps the most
marvelous speck of matter in the universe. Again "the physicists
tell us that the behaviour of hydrogen gas makes it necessary to
suppose that an atom of it must have a constitution as complex as
a constellation, with about eight hundred separate corpuscles."[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 176.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The danger of "pure science."</b> The fascinations of disinterested
inquiry are so great that they may lead to a kind of scientific
intemperance. The abstracted scientific interest may become so
absorbed in the working-out of small details that it becomes
over-specialized, narrow, and pedantic. The pure theorist has always
been regarded with suspicion by the <a name="page_377"><span
class="page">Page 377</span></a> practical man. His concern over
details of flora or fauna, over the precise minuti&aelig; of ancient
hieroglyphics, seems absurdly trivial in comparison with the central
passions and central purposes of mankind. There are workers in every
department of knowledge who become wrapt up in their specialties,
forgetting the forest for the trees. There are men so absorbed
in probing the crevices of their own little niche of knowledge
that they forget the bearings of their researches. Especially in
time of stress, of war or social unrest, men have felt a certain
callousness about the interests of the abstrusely remote scholar.
We shall have occasion to note presently that it is in this coldness
and emancipation from the pressing demands of the moment that science
has produced its most pronounced eventual benefits for mankind.
But an uncontrolled passion for facts and relations may degenerate
into a mere play and luxury that may have its fascination for the
expert himself, but affords neither sweetness nor light to any one
else. One has but to go over the lists of doctors' dissertations
published by German universities during the late nineteenth century
to find examples of inquiry that seem to afford not the slightest
justification in the way of eventual good to mankind.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: It is only fair to say that literary studies have
been marked by more barren and fruitless investigations (purely
philological inquiry, for example) than have the physical sciences.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Practical or applied science.</b> Thus far we have been considering
science chiefly as an activity which satisfies some men as an activity
in itself, by the &aelig;sthetic, emotional, and intellectual values
they derive from it. But a fact at once paradoxical and significant
in the history of human progress is that this most impersonal and
disinterested of man's activities has been profoundly influential
in its practical fruits. The practical application of the sciences
rests on the utilization of the exact formulations of pure science.
Through these formulations we can control phenomena by artificially
setting up relations of which science has learned the consequences,
<a name="page_378"><span class="page">Page 378</span></a> thus
attaining the consequences we desire, and avoiding those we do not.
</p>

<p class="include">
The <i>direct</i> influence of pure science on practical life is
enormous. The observations of Newton on the relations between a
falling stone and the moon, of Galvani on the convulsive movements
of frogs' legs in contact with iron and copper, of Darwin on the
adaptation of woodpeckers, of tree-frogs, and of seeds to their
surroundings, of Kirchhoff on certain lines which occur in the
spectrum of sunlight, of other investigators on the life-history
of bacteria&mdash;these and kindred observations have not only
revolutionized our conception of the universe, but they have
revolutionized or are revolutionizing, our practical life, our
means of transit, our social conduct, our treatment of disease.[1]

Francis Bacon was one of the first to appreciate explicitly the
possibilities of the control of nature in the interests of human
welfare. He saw the vast possibilities which a careful and comprehensive
study of the workings of nature had in the enlargement of human
comfort, security, and power. In <i>The New Atlantis</i> he envisages
an ideal commonwealth, whose unique and singular institution is a
House of Solomon, a kind of Carnegie Foundation devoted to inquiry,
the fruits of which might be, as they were, exploited in the interests
of human happiness: "The end of our foundation is the knowledge of
causes and the secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the
bounds of human empire to the effecting of all things possible."[2]

<p class="indent">
Science sometimes appears so remote and alien to the immediate
concrete objects which meet and interest us in daily experience
that we tend to forget that historically it was out of concrete
needs and practical interests that science arose. Geometry, seemingly
a clear case of abstract and theoretical science, arose out of

The application of the exact knowledge gained by the pure sciences,
may, if properly directed, immeasurably increase the <a
name="page_379"><span class="page">Page 379</span></a> sum of human
welfare. One has but to review briefly the history of invention to
appreciate this truth with vividness and detail. The great variety
of the "applied sciences" shows the extent and multiplicity of the
fruits of theoretical inquiry. Astronomy plays an important part in
navigation; but it also earns its living by helping the surveyor and
the mapmaker and by supplying the world with accurate time. Industrial
chemistry offers, perhaps, the most striking examples. There is,
for example, the fixation of nitrogen, which makes possible the
artificial production of ammonia and potash; the whole group of
dye industries made possible through the chemical production of
coal tar; the industrial utilization of cellulose in the paper,
twine, and leather industries; the promise of eventual production
on a large scale of synthetic rubber; the electric furnace, which,
with its fourteen-thousand-degree range of heat, makes possible
untold increase in the effectiveness of all the chemical industries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Industrial chemistry is only one instance. The application of
theoretical inquiry in physics has made possible the telegraph,
the telephone, wireless telegraphy, electric motors, and flying
machines. Mineralogy and oceanography have opened up new stores of
natural resources. Biological research has had diverse applications.
Bacteriological inquiry has been fruitfully applied in surgery,
hygiene, agriculture, and the artificial preservation of food. The
principles of Mendelian inheritance have been used in the practical
improvement of domestic animals and cultivated plants. The list
might be indefinitely extended. The sciences arose as attempts,
more or less successful, to solve man's practical problems. They
became historically cut off, as they may in the case of the pure
scientist still be cut off, from practical considerations. But
no matter how remote and abstract they become, they yield again
practical fruits.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Applied science, if it becomes too narrowly interested in practical
results, limits its own resources. Purely theoretical inquiry may be
of the most immense ultimate advantage. In <a name="page_380"><span
class="page">Page 380</span></a> a sense the more abstract and
remote science becomes, the more eventual promise it contains. By
getting away from the confusing and irrelevant details of particular
situations, science is enabled to frame generalizations applicable
to a wide array of phenomena differing in detail, but having in
common significant characteristics. Men can learn fruitfully to
control their experience precisely because they can emancipate
themselves from the immediate demands of practical life, from the
suggestions that arise in the course of instinctive and habitual
action. "A certain power of <i>abstraction</i>, of deliberate turning
away from the habitual responses to a situation, was required before
men could be emancipated to follow up suggestions that in the end
are fruitful."[1]
</p>

</p>

<p class="indent">
Too complete absorption in immediate problems may operate to deprive
action of that sweeping and penetrating vision which a freer inquiry
affords. The temporarily important may be the less important in the
long run. A practical adjustment of detail may produce immediate
benefits in the way of improved industrial processes and more rapid
and economical production, but some seemingly obscure discovery
in the most abstruse reaches of scientific theory may eventually
be of untold practical significance.

Only the extremely ignorant can question the utility of, let us
say, the prolonged application of the Greek intellect to the laws
of conic sections. Whether we think of bridges or projectiles, of
the curves of ships, or of the rules of navigation, we must think
of conic sections. The rules of navigation, for instance, are in
part based on astronomy. Kepler's Laws are foundation stones of that
science, but Kepler discovered that Mars moves in an ellipse round
the sun in one of the foci by a deduction from conic sections....
Yet the historical fact is that these conic sections were studied
as an abstract science for eighteen centuries before they came
to be of their highest use.[2]

Practical life has been continually enriched by theoretical inquiry.
Scientific descriptions increase in value as they become absolutely
impersonal, absolutely precise, and especially as they become condensed

<p class="indent">
<b>Analysis of scientific procedure.</b> Scientific method is merely
common sense made more thoroughgoing and systematic. Reflection of
a more or less effective kind takes place in ordinary experience
wherever instinctive or habitual action is not adequate to meet
a situation, whenever the individual has a problem to solve, an
adjustment to make. Thinking, of some kind, goes on continually.
Scientific thinking merely means careful, safeguarded, systematic
thinking. It is thinking alert and critical of its own methods. As
contrasted with ordinary common-sense thinking, it is distinguished
by "caution, carefulness, thoroughness, definiteness, exactness,
orderliness, and methodic arrangement." We think, in any case,
because we have to, being creatures born with a set of instincts
not adequate to meet the conditions of our environment. We can
think carelessly and ineffectively, or carefully and successfully.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Scientific method, or orderly, critical, and systematic thinking,
is not applicable to one subject-matter exclusively. Examples are
commonly drawn from the physical or chemical or biological laboratory,
but the elements of scientific method may be illustrated in the
procedure of a business man meeting a practical problem, a lawyer
sifting evidence, a statesman framing a new piece of legislation.
In all these cases the difference between a genuinely scientific
procedure and mere casual and random common sense is the same.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_382"><span class="page">Page 382</span></a> Science
is nothing but <i>trained and organized common sense</i>, differing
from the latter only as a veteran may differ from a raw recruit:
and its methods differ from those of common sense only so far as
the guardsman's cut and thrust differ from the manner in which
a savage wields his club. The primary power is the same in each
case, and perhaps the untutored savage has the more brawny arm of
the two. The <i>real</i> advantage lies in the point and polish
of the swordsman's weapon; in the trained eye quick to spy out
the weakness of the adversary; in the ready hand prompt to follow
it on the instant. But, after all, the sword exercise is only the
hewing and poking of the clubman refined and developed.

So, the vast results obtained by science are won by ... no mental
processes, other than those which are practiced by everyone of us,
in the humblest and meanest affairs of life. A detective policeman
discovers a burglar from the marks made by his shoe, by a mental
process identical with that by which Cuvier restored the extinct
animals of Montmartre from fragments of their bones.... Nor does
that process of induction and deduction by which a lady finding a
stain of a peculiar kind upon her dress, concludes that somebody
has upset the inkstand thereon, differ, in any way, in kind, from

the veriest bookworm of us all.[1]

</p>

<p class="indent">
The scientific procedure becomes, as we shall see, highly complicated,
involving elaborate processes of observation, classification,
generalization, deduction or development of ideas, and testing. But
it remains thinking just the same, and originates in some problem
or perplexity, just as thinking does in ordinary life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Science and common sense.</b> It is profitable to note in some
detail the ways in which scientific method, in spirit and technique,
differs from common-sense thinking. It is more insistent in the first
place on including the whole range of relevant data, of bringing
to light all the facts that bear on a <a name="page_383"><span
class="page">Page 383</span></a> given problem. In common-sense
thinking we make, as we say, snap judgments; we jump at conclusions.
Anything plausible is accepted as evidence; anything heard or seen
is accepted as a fact. The scientific examiner insists on examining
and subjecting to scrutiny the facts at hand, on searching for
further facts, and on distinguishing the facts genuinely significant
in a given situation from these that happen to be glaring or
conspicuous. This is merely another way of saying that both accuracy
and completeness of observation are demanded, accuracy in the
examination of the facts present, and completeness in the array
of facts bearing on the question at hand.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Scientific thinking is thus primarily inquiring and skeptical. It
queries the usual; it tries, as we say, to penetrate beneath the
surface. Common sense, for example, gives suction as the explanation
of water rising in a pump. But where, as at a great height above sea
level, this mysterious power of suction does not operate, or when
it is found that it does not raise water above thirty-two feet,
common sense is at a loss. Scientific thinking tries to analyze
the gross fact, and by accurately and completely observing all
the facts bearing on the phenomenon endeavors to find out "what
<i>special</i> conditions are present when the effect occurs" and
absent when it does not occur. Instead of trying to fit all unusual,
contradictory, or exceptional facts into <i>a priori</i> ideas
based on miscellaneous and unsifted facts, it starts without any
<i>fixed</i> conclusions beforehand, but carefully observes all the
facts which it can secure with reference to a particular problem,
deliberately seeking the exceptional and unusual as crucial instances.
Thus in a sociological inquiry, the scientist, instead of accepting
"common-sense" judgments (based on a variety of miscellaneous,
incomplete, and unsifted facts) that certain races are inferior
or superior, tries, by specific inquiries, to establish the facts
of racial capacities or defects. Instead of accepting proverbial
wisdom and popular estimates of the relative capacities of men and
women, he tries by careful observation and <a name="page_384"><span
class="page">Page 384</span></a> experiment accurately to discover
all the facts bearing on the question, and to generalize from those
facts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Scientific method thus discounts prejudice or dogmatism. A prejudice
is literally a pre-judgment. Common sense sizes up the situation
beforehand. Instead of examining a situation in its own terms, and
<i>arriving</i> at a conclusion, it <i>starts</i> with one. The
so-called hard-headed man of common sense <i>knows</i> beforehand.
He has a definite and stereotyped reaction for every situation with
which he comes in contact. These rubber-stamp responses, these
unconsidered generalizations, originate in instinctive desires, or in
preferences acquired through habit. Common sense finds fixed pigeon
holes into which to fit all the variety of specific circumstances
and conditions which characterize experience. "When its judgments
happen to be correct, it is almost as much a matter of good luck
as of method.... That potatoes should be planted only during the
crescent moon, that near the sea people are born at high tide and
die at low tide, that a comet is an omen of danger, that bad luck
follows the cracking of a mirror," all these are the results of
common-sense observation. Matters of common knowledge are thus
not infrequently matters of common misinformation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Common-sense knowledge is largely a matter of uncritical belief.
When there is absent scientific examination of the sources and
grounds of belief, those judgments and conclusions are likely to be
accepted which happen to have wide social currency and authority.
In an earlier chapter, it was shown how the mere fact of an opinion
prevailing among a large number of one's group or class gives it great
emotional weight. Where opinions are not determined by intelligent
examination and decision, they are determined by force of habit, early
education, and the social influences to which one is constantly
exposed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The scientific spirit is a spirit of emancipated inquiry as contrasted
with blind acceptance of belief upon authority. The phenomenal
developments of modern science began <a name="page_385"><span
class="page">Page 385</span></a> when men ceased to accept
authoritatively their beliefs about man and nature, and undertook
to examine phenomena in their own terms. The phenomenal rise of
modern science is coincident with the collapse of unquestioning
faith as the leading ingredient of intellectual life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Common sense renders men peculiarly insensitive to the possibilities
of the novel, peculiarly susceptible to the influence of tradition.
It was common sense that credited the influence of the position of
the stars upon men's welfare, the power of old women as witches, and
the unhealthiness of night air. It was common sense also that ridiculed
Fulton's steamboat, laughed at the early attempts of telegraphy and
telephony, and dismissed the aeroplane as an interesting toy. The
characteristic feature of common sense or empirical thinking is its
excess traditionalism, its wholesale acceptance of authority,[1]
its reliance upon precedent. Where beliefs are not subjected to
critical revision and examination, to the constant surveillance
of the inquiring intelligence, there will be no criterion by which
to estimate the true and the false, the important and the trivial.
All beliefs that have wide social sanction, or that chime in with
immediate sense impressions, established individual habits, or
social customs will be accepted with the same indiscriminate
hospitality. To common sense the sun <i>does</i> appear to go round
the earth; the stick <i>does</i> appear broken in water. Thus "totally
false opinions may appear to the holder of them to possess all the
character of rationally verifiable truth."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "Authority" in this sense of social prestige must be
distinguished from "authority" in the sense of scientific authority.
The acceptance of the authority of the expert is the acceptance
of opinions that we have good reason to believe are the result
of scientific inquiry.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The dangers and falsities of common-sense judgments are conditioned
not only by expectations and standards fixed by the social environment,
but by one's own personal predilections and aversions. Recent
developments in psychology have made much of the fact that many of
our so-called reasoned judgments are rationalizations, secondary
reasons <a name="page_386"><span class="page">Page 386</span></a>
found after our initial, primary, and deep-seated emotional responses
have been made. They are the result of emotional "complexes," fears,
expectations, and desires of which we are not ourselves conscious.[1]
It is from these limiting conditions of personal preference and
social environment that scientific method frees us.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: "When a party politician is called upon to consider a
new measure, his verdict is largely determined by certain constant
systems of ideas and trends of thought, constituting what is generally
known as 'party bias.' We should describe these systems in our
newly acquired terminology as his 'political complex.' The complex
causes him to take up an attitude toward the proposed measure which
is quite independent of any absolute merits that the latter may
possess. If we argue with our politician, we shall find that the
complex will reinforce in his mind those arguments which support
the view of his party, while it will infallibly prevent him from
realizing the force of the arguments propounded by the opposite
side. Now, it should be observed that the individual himself is
probably quite unaware of this mechanism in his mind. He fondly
imagines that his opinion is formed solely by the logical pros
and cons of the measure before him. We see, in fact, that not only
is his thinking determined by a complex of whose action he is
unconscious, but that he believes his thoughts to be the result of
other causes which are in reality insufficient and illusory. This
latter process of self-deception, in which the individual conceals
the real foundation of his thought by a series of adventitious
props, is termed 'rationalization.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The two mechanisms which manifest themselves in our example of
the politician, the unconscious origin of beliefs and actions,
and the subsequent process of rationalization to which they are
subjected, are of fundamental importance in psychology." (Bernard
Hart: <i>The Psychology of Insanity</i>, pp. 64-66.)]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, even where common-sense judgments are not particularly qualified
by such conditions, they are frequently based upon the observation
of purely accidental conjunctions of circumstances. A sequence once
or twice observed is taken as the basis of a causal relation. This
gives rise to what is known in technical logic as the <i>post hoc
ergo propter hoc</i> fallacy; that is, the assumption that because
one thing happens after another, therefore it happens <i>because</i>
of it. Many superstitions probably had their origin in such chance
observations, and belief in them is strengthened by some accidental
confirmation. Thus if a man walks under a ladder one day and dies
the next, the believer in the superstition that walking under a
ladder brings fatal results will find in this instance a clear
ratification of his belief. There seems to be <a name="page_387"><span
class="page">Page 387</span></a> an inveterate human tendency to
seek for causes, and by those who are not scientific inquirers
causes are lightly assigned. It is easiest and most plausible to
assign as a cause an immediately preceding circumstance. Exceptional
or contradictory circumstances are then either unnoticed or pared
down to fit the belief.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Scientific method does not depend on such chance conjunctions of
circumstance, but controls its observations or experimentally arranges
conditions so as to discover what are the conditions necessary
to produce given effects, or what effects invariably follow from
given causes. It does not accept a chance conjunction as evidence
of an invariable relation, but seeks, under regulated conditions,
to discover what the genuinely invariable relations are. This method
of controlling our generalizations about the facts of experience,
we shall presently examine in some detail.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Curiosity and scientific inquiry.</b> Curiosity, the instinctive
basis of the desire to know, is the basis of scientific inquiry.
Without this fundamental desire, there could be no sustaining motive
to deep and thoroughgoing scientific research, for theoretical
investigations do not always give promise of immediate practical
benefits. The scientific interest is a development of that restless
curiosity for a knowledge of the world in which they are living which
children so markedly exhibit. Beginning as a kind of miscellaneous
and omnivorous appetite for facts of whatever description, it grows
into a desire to understand the unsuspected and hidden relations
between facts, to penetrate to the unities discoverable beneath
the mysteries and multiplicities of things.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The scientific mood is thus in the first place a sheer instinctive
curiosity, a basic passion for facts. It is this which sustains
the scientific worker in the sometimes long and dreary business of
collecting specimens, instances, details. Many of the most notable
scientific advances, as Lord Kelvin pointed out, must be attributed
to the most protracted and unmitigated drudgery in the collection of
facts, a thoroughgoing and <a name="page_388"><span class="page">Page
388</span></a> trying labor in which the scientific worker could
persist only when fortified by an eager and insistent curiosity.
This "hodman's work" is the basis of the great generalizations
which constitute the framework of the modern scientific systems.
"The monotonous and quantitative work of star-cataloguing has been
continued from Hipparchus, who began his work more than a century
before Christ, work which is continued even to the present day. This
work, uninspiring as it seems, is yet an essential basis for the
applications of astronomy, the determination of time, navigation,
surveying. Furthermore, without good star places, we can have no
theory of the motions of the solar system, and without accurate
catalogues of the stars we can know nothing of the grander problems
of the universe, the motion of our sun among the stars, or of the
stars among themselves."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Hinks: <i>Astronomy</i>, p. 162.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not only is curiosity a sustaining motive in the drudgery of collection
and research incident and essential to scientific generalization; it
alone makes possible that suspense of judgment which is necessary
to fruitful scientific inquiry. This suspense is, as we have already
seen, difficult for most men. Action demands immediate decision, and
inquiry deliberately postpones decision. It is only a persistent
desire to "get at the bottom of the matter" that will act as a
check upon the demands of social life and of individual impatience
which rush us to conclusions. In most men, as earlier noted, the
sharp edge of curiosity becomes easily blunted. They are content,
outside their own immediate personal interests, "to take things
for granted." They glide over the surfaces of events, they cease
to query the authenticity of facts, or to examine their relevance
and their significance, or to be concerned about their completeness.
For an example, one has but to listen to or partake in the average
discussion of any political or social issue of the present day.
There are few men who retain, even as far as middle life, a genuinely
inquiring interest in men and affairs. Their curiosity is dulled by
fatigue and the pressure <a name="page_389"><span class="page">Page
389</span></a> of their own interests and preoccupations, and they
allow their prejudices and formulas to pass for judgments and
conclusions. The scientist is the man in whom curiosity has become
a permanent passion, who, as long as he lives, is unwilling to
forego inquiry into the processes of Nature, or of human relations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Thinking begins with a problem.</b> While the general habit
of inquiry is developed in the satisfaction of the instinct of
curiosity, any particular investigation begins with a felt difficulty.
By difficulty is not meant one of an imperative and practical kind,
but any problem whether theoretical or practical. For many men, it
is true, thinking occurs only when instinct and habit are inadequate
to adjust them to their environment. Any problem of daily life affords
an example. To borrow an illustration from Professor Dewey:
</p>

<p class="include">
A man traveling in an unfamiliar region comes to a branching of the
roads. Having no sure knowledge to fall back upon, he is brought
to a standstill of hesitation and suspense. Which road is right? And
how shall the perplexity be resolved? There are but two alternatives.
He must either blindly and arbitrarily take his course, trusting to
luck for the outcome, or he must discover grounds for the conclusion
that a given road is right.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote l: Dewey: <i>How We Think</i>, p. 10.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To the inquiring mind, purely theoretical difficulties or discrepancies
will provoke thought. To the astronomer an unaccounted-for perturbation
in the path of a planet provokes inquiry; the chemist is challenged
by a curious unexplained reaction of two chemical elements, the
biologist, anterior to the discovery of micro-organisms, by the
putrefaction of animal tissues. The degree to which curiosity persists
and the extent of training a man has had in a given field largely
determine the kind of situations that will provoke inquiry. "A
primrose by the river's brim" may be simply a primrose to one man,
while to another, a botanist, it may suggest an interesting and
complex problem of classification.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But however remote and recondite thinking becomes, however <a
name="page_390"><span class="page">Page 390</span></a> far removed
from immediate practical concerns, it occurs essentially in a situation
analogous to the "forked-road situation" described above. The situation
as it stands is confused, ambiguous, uncertain. In a practical
problem, for example, there are two or more courses of action open
to us, all of them giving promise as solutions of our difficulties.
We aim through reflection to reduce the uncertainty, to clarify
the situation, to discover more clearly the consequences of the
various alternatives which suggest themselves to us. When action
is unimpeded, suggestions flow on just as they arise in our minds.
This is illustrated best in the reveries of a day-dream when casual
and disconnected fancies follow each other in random and uncontrolled
succession. But when there is a problem to be settled, an ambiguity
to be resolved, suggestions are held in check and controlled with
reference to the end we have in view; each suggestion is estimated
with regard to its relevance to the problem in hand. Every idea that
arises is, so to speak, queried: "Is it or is it not a solution
to our present difficulty?"
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are indebted to Professor Dewey, for an analysis of the thought
process. Every instance of thinking reveals five steps:
</p>

<p class="indent">
(1) A felt difficulty, (2) its location and definition, (3) suggestions
of possible solutions, (4) development by reasoning of the bearings of
the most promising suggestion, (5) further observation or experiment
leading to its acceptance or rejection, that is a conclusion either
of belief or disbelief.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When instinct or habit suffices to adjust us to our environment,
action runs along smoothly, freely, uninterruptedly. In consequence
the provocation to thinking may at first be a mere vague shock
or disturbance. We are, as it were, in trouble without knowing
precisely what the trouble is. We must carefully inquire into the
nature of the problem before undertaking a solution. To take a
simple instance, an automobile may suddenly stop. We know there is
a difficulty, but whether it is a difficulty with the transmission,
with the <a name="page_391"><span class="page">Page 391</span></a>
carburetor, or with the supply of gasoline, we cannot at first
tell. Before we do anything else in solving our problem, we find
out literally and precisely <i>what the trouble is</i>. To take
a different situation, a doctor does not undertake to prescribe
for a patient until he has diagnosed the difficulty, found out
precisely what the features of the problem are.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The second step after the situation has been examined and its precise
elements defined, is <i>suggestion</i>. That is, we consider the
various possibilities which <i>suggest</i> themselves as solutions
to our problem. There may be several ways of temporarily repairing
our engine; the doctor may think of two or three possible treatments
for a disease. In one sense, suggestion is uncontrollable. The kind
of suggestions that occur to an individual depend on his "genius
or temperament," on his past experiences, on his hopes or fears or
expectations when that particular situation occurs. We can, however,
through the methods of science, control suggestions indirectly. We
can do this, in the first place, by re&euml;xamining the facts which
give rise to suggestion. If upon close examination, the facts appear
differently from what they did at first, we will derive different
inferences from them. Different suggestions will arise from the facts
<i>A, B, C</i>, than from the facts <i>A', B', C'</i>. Again we
can regulate the conditions under which credence is given to the
various suggestions that arise. These suggestions are entertained
merely as tentative, and are not accepted until experimentally
verified. "The suggested conclusion as only tentatively entertained
constitutes an idea."
</p>

<p class="indent">
After the variety of suggestions that proffer themselves as solutions
to a problem have been considered, the third step is the logical
development of the idea or suggestion that gives most promise of
solving the difficulty. That is, even before further facts are
sought, the idea that gives promise of being a solution is followed
out to its logical consequences. Thus, for example, astronomers
were for a long time puzzled by unexplained perturbations in the
path of the planet Uranus. The suggestion occurred that an unseen
planet was deflecting it <a name="page_392"><span class="page">Page
392</span></a> from the path it should, from observation and
calculation, be following. If this were the case, from the amount
of deflection it was mathematically calculated, prior to any further
observation, that the supposed planet should appear at a certain
point in space. It was by this deductive elaboration that the planet
Neptune was discovered. It was figured out deductively that a planet
deflecting the path of the planet Uranus by just so-and-so much
should be found at just such and such a particular point in the
heavens. When the telescopes were turned in that direction, the
planet Neptune was discovered at precisely the point deductively
forecast.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The elaboration of an idea through reasoning it out may sometimes
lead to its rejection. But in thinking out its details we may for
the first time note its appositeness to the solution of the problem
in hand. The gross suggestion may seem wild and absurd, but when
its bearings and consequences are logically developed there may
be some item in the development which dovetails into the problem
as its solution. William James gives as the outstanding feature
of reasoning, "sagacity, or the perception of the essence."[1]
By this he meant the ability to single out of a complex situation
or idea the significant or key feature. It is only by a logical
development of a suggested solution to a problem that it is possible
to hit upon the essence of the matter for a particular situation, to
single out of a gross total situation, the key to the phenomenon.
"In reasoning, <i>A</i> may suggest <i>B</i>; but <i>B</i>, instead
of being an idea which is simply <i>obeyed</i> by us, is an idea
which suggests the distinct additional idea <i>C</i>. And where
the train of suggestion is one of reasoning distinctively so-called
as contrasted with mere 'revery,' ... the ideas bear certain inward
relations to each other which we must carefully examine. The result
<i>C</i> yielded by a true act of reasoning is apt to be a thing
voluntarily <i>sought</i>, such as the means to a proposed end,
the ground for an observed effect, or the effect of an assumed
cause."[2] Thus what at first sight might <a name="page_393"><span
class="page">Page 393</span></a> seem a fantastic suggestion may,
when its bearings are logically followed out, be seen in one of its
aspects to be the key to the solution of a problem. To primitive
man it might have seemed absurd to suggest that flowing water might
be used as power; to the man in Franklin's day that the same force
that was exhibited in the lightning might be used in transportation
and in lighting houses.[1]

is a mere association of two totals, diseased object and remedy.
One learned in pneumatics could have named the <i>cause</i> of
the disease, and thence inferred the remedy immediately. By many
measurements of triangles, one might find their area always equal to
their height multiplied by half their base, and one might formulate
an empirical law to that effect. But a reasoner saves himself all
this trouble, by seeing that it is the essence (<i>pro hac vice</i>)
of a triangle to be the half of a parallelogram whose area is the
height into the entire base. To see this he must invent additional
lines; and the geometer must often draw such to get at the essential
properties he may require in a figure. The essence consists in
some <i>relation of the figure to the new lines</i>, a relation
not obvious at all until they are put in. The geometer's sagacity
lies in the invention of the new lines." (<i>Psychology</i>, vol.
II, pp. 339-40.)]

<p class="indent">
But no thinking is conclusive until after the experimental certification
and warranting of the idea which has been held in mind as the solution
of the problem. By deduction, by logical elaboration of an idea,
we find its adoption involves certain consequences. Some of the
logical consequences which follow from an idea may indicate that it
is a plausible solution of our problem. But no matter how plausible
a suggestion looks, until it is verified by observation or experiment
the thinking process is not concluded, is not finished, as we say,
<i>conclusively</i>. When an idea or a suggestion has been developed,
and seen to involve&mdash;as an idea&mdash;certain inevitable logical
consequences, the idea must be tested by further observation and
experiment. Suggestions arise <i>from</i> facts and must be tested
<i>by</i> them. Until the suggestion is verified, it remains merely
a suggestion, a theory, a hypothesis, an idea. It is only when
the consequences implied logically <a name="page_394"><span
class="page">Page 394</span></a> in the very idea itself are found
in the actual situation that the idea is accepted as a solution to
the problem. Sometimes the suggestion may be verified by observation;
sometimes conditions must be deliberately arranged for testing its
adequacy. In either case it is only when the facts of the situation
correspond to the conditions theoretically involved that the tentative
idea is accepted as a conclusion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus a treatment that is regarded by the doctor as a possible cure
can be called an actual cure only when its beneficent results are
observed. The supposition about the planet Neptune is only verified
when the planet is actually observed in the heavens. Thinking ends,
as it begins, in observation. At the beginning the facts are carefully
examined to see precisely where the difficulty lies; at the end they
are again examined to see whether an idea, an entertained hypothesis,
a suggested solution, can be verified in actual observable results.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The quality of thinking&mdash;Suggestion.</b> The quality of
thinking varies, first, with the fertility of suggestion of the
analyzing mind. Ease of suggestion, in the first place, depends on
innate individual differences. There are some minds so constituted
that every fact provokes a multitude of suggestions. Readiness in
responding with "ideas" to any experience is dependent primarily on
initial differences in resilience and responsiveness. But differences
in training and past experience are also contributory. A man who
has much experience in a given field, say in automobile repairing,
will, given a difficulty, not only think of more suggestions, but
think more rapidly in that field.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again persons differ in range or number of suggestions that occur.
The quality of the thinking process and of the results it produces
depends, in part, on the variety of suggestions which occur to an
individual in the solution of a given problem. If too few suggestions
occur one may fail to hit upon any promising solution. If too many
suggestions occur one may be too confused to arrive at any conclusion
at all. Whether an <a name="page_395"><span class="page">Page
395</span></a> individual has few or many suggestions depends largely
on native differences. It depends, also, however in part, on
acquaintance with a given field. And the fertility of suggestions
may be increased by a careful survey and re-survey of the facts at
hand, and by the deliberate searching-out of further facts from
which further suggestions may be derived. Suggestions differ, finally,
in regard to depth or significance; by nature and by training,
individuals produce ideas of varying degrees of significance in
the solution of problems. Ease and versatility of suggestion not
infrequently connote superficiality; to make profound and far-reaching
suggestions takes time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is further requisite, as already pointed out, that the analyzing
mind be free from prejudice. Thinking is continually qualified, as we
have seen, by preferences and aversions. Every prejudice, every <i>a
priori</i> belief we have, literally prejudges the inquiry. Whenever
we are moved by a "predominant passion," we cannot survey the facts
impartially. It is hard to think clearly and justly about people
whom we love or hate, or to estimate with precision the morality
of actions toward which we are moved by very strong impulses. It
is only the mind that remains resolutely emancipated from the
compulsions of habit and circumstances, that persists in surveying
facts as they are, letting the chips, so to speak, fall where they
will, that can be really effective in thinking. In the physical
sciences it is comparatively easy to start with no prejudices;
in social inquiries where we are bound by traditions, loyalties,
and antipathies it is much more difficult.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not the least essential to effective thinking is persistence and
thoroughness of investigation. Since we are primarily creatures
of action, we crave definiteness and immediacy of decision, and
there is a constant temptation to rush to a conclusion. In order to
attain genuine completeness of the facts and certainty and accuracy
as to what the facts are, long, unwavering persistence is required.
There must be persistence, moreover, not merely because of the
length of time and the <a name="page_396"><span class="page">Page
396</span></a> amount of labor involved in the collection of data;
steadiness is required in holding in mind the end or purpose of the
investigation. Too often in inquiry into the facts of human relations,
the specific problem is forgotten and facts are collected with an
indiscriminate omnivorousness. There is in such cases plodding, but
of an unenlightened and fruitless sort. Not only <i>persistency</i>
but <i>consistency</i> is required. The investigation must be steadily
carried on with persistent and unwavering reference to the specific
business in hand.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Effective thinking depends further on familiarity with the field
of facts under investigation. Even the most ready and fertile of
minds, the most orderly habits of thought, are at a loss without
a store of material; that is, facts from which suggestions may
arise. And this store of materials can only be attained through a
thoroughgoing acquaintance with the particular field of inquiry.
Thinking aims to explain the relations between facts, and an intimate
acquaintance with facts involved in a given situation is prerequisite
to any generalization whatsoever.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While the native fertility of given minds cannot be controlled,
suggestions can be controlled indirectly. Suggestions arise from
the data at hand, but the data themselves change under more precise
conditions of observation, and the suggestions that arise from them
change in consequence. The whole elaborate apparatus of science, its
instruments of precision, are designed to yield an exact determination
of the precise nature of the data at hand. The scientist attempts to
prevent "reading-in" of meanings. "Reading-in" of meanings may be
due to various causes. In the first place there may be purely physical
causes: a dim light, a fog, a cracked window-pane are examples of
how ordinary observation may lead us astray. Again, physiological
causes may be at work to distort sensations: imperfection's in
the sense organs, fatigue, illness, and the like are examples.
But not least among the causes of error must be set psychological
causes. That is, we read facts differently in the light of what
we fear or hope, <a name="page_397"><span class="page">Page
397</span></a> like or dislike, expect or recall. We see things
the way we want them to be, or the way previous experience has
taught us to expect them to be.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both physiological and psychological causes may be checked up by
instruments. Indeed, one of the chief utilities of instruments of
precision is that they do serve to check up personal error. They
prevent scientific inquirers from reading in meanings to which
they are led by hope, fear, preference, or aversion. They help
us to see the facts as they are, not as for various social and
personal reasons we want or expect them to be. They help to give
precise and permanent impressions which are not dependent for their
discovery or for their preservation on the precariousness of human
observation or memory.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Classification.</b> Next only in importance to accurate observation
of the facts is their classification. Objects of experience as they
come to us through the senses appear in a sequence which is random
and chaotic. But in order to deal effectively with our experience we
must arrange facts according to their likenesses and differences.
Whenever we discover certain striking similarities between facts,
we classify them, place them in a class, knowing that what will
apply to one will apply to all. Some logicians go so far as to say
that science cannot go any further than accurate classification.
In the words of Poincar&eacute;:
</p>

<p class="include">
The most interesting facts are those which may serve many times;
these are the facts which have a chance of coming up again. We
have been so fortunate as to have been born in a world where there
are such. Suppose that instead of sixty chemical elements there
were sixty milliards of them, that they were not some common, the
others rare, but that they were equally distributed. Then, every
time we picked up a new pebble there would be great probability
of its being formed of some unknown substance; all that we knew
of other pebbles would be worthless for it; before each new object
we should be as the new-born babe; like it we could only obey our
caprices or our needs. Biologists would be just as much at a loss
if there were only individuals and no species, and if heredity
did not make sons like their fathers.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Poincar&eacute;: <i>Foundations of Science</i>, p.
363.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_398"><span class="page">Page 398</span></a> The aim
of classification in science is grouping in such a way as to make
manifest at once similarities in the behavior of objects. That
characteristic is selected as a basis of classification with which
is correlated the greatest number of other characteristics belonging
to the facts in question. It would be possible to classify all
living things according to color, but such a classification would
be destitute of scientific value. Biology offers some interesting
examples of how an illuminating classification may be made on the
basis of a single characteristic. It has been found, for example,
that the differences or resemblances of animals are correlated
with corresponding differences or resemblances in their teeth.
In general, the function of classification may be summarized in
Huxley's definition as modified by Jevons:
</p>

<p class="include">
By the classification of any series of objects is meant the actual
or ideal arrangement together of those things which are like and
the separation of those things which are unlike, the purpose of
the arrangement being, primarily, to disclose the correlations or
laws of union of properties and circumstances, and, secondarily,
to facilitate the operations of the mind in clearly conceiving and
retaining in memory the characters of the object in question.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It should be noted that the object of classification is not simply
to indicate similarities but to indicate distinctions or differences.
In scientific inquiry, differences are as crucial in the forming of
generalizations as similarities. It is only possible to classify
a given fact under a scientific generalization when the given fact
is set off from other facts, when it is seen to be the result of
certain special conditions.
</p>

<p class="include">
If a man infers from a single sample of grain as to the grade of
wheat of the car as a whole, it is induction, and under certain
circumstances, a <i>sound</i> induction; other cases are resorted
to simply for the sake of rendering that induction more guarded
and correct. In the case of the various samples of grain, it is
the fact that the samples are unlike, at least in the part of the
carload from which they are taken, that is important. Were it not
for this unlikeness, their likeness in quality would be of no avail
in assisting inference.[1]

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_399"><span class="page">Page 399</span></a>
<b>Experimental variation of conditions.</b> In forming our
generalizations from the observation of situations as they occur
in Nature, we are at a disadvantage. If we observe cases just as we
find them, there is much present that is irrelevant to our problem;
much that is of genuine importance in its solution is hidden or
obscure. In experimental investigation we are, in the words of Sir
John Herschel, "active observers"; we deliberately invent crucial
or test cases. That is, we deliberately arrange conditions so that
every factor is definitely known and recognized. We then introduce
into this set of completely known conditions one change, one new
circumstance, and observe its effect. In Mill's phrase, we "take
a phenomenon home with us," and watch its behavior. Mill states
clearly the outstanding advantage of experimentation over observation:
</p>

<p class="include">
When we can produce a phenomenon artificially, we can take it, as
it were, home with us, and observe it in the midst of circumstances
with which in all other respects we are accurately acquainted.
If we desire to know what are the effects of the cause <i>A</i>,
and are able to produce <i>A</i> by means at our disposal, we can
generally determine at our own discretion ... the whole of the
circumstances which shall be present along with it; and thus, knowing
exactly the simultaneous state of everything else which is within
the reach of <i>A's</i> influence, we have only to observe what
alteration is made in that state by the presence of <i>A</i>.
</p>

<p class="include">
For example, by the electric machine we can produce, in the midst
of known circumstances, the phenomena which Nature exhibits on a
grander scale in the form of lightning and thunder. Now let any
one consider what amount of knowledge of the effects and laws of
electric agency mankind could have obtained from the mere observation
of thunderstorms, and compare it with that which they have gained,
and may expect to gain, from electrical and galvanic experiments....
</p>

<p class="include">
When we have succeeded in isolating the phenomenon which is the
subject of inquiry, by placing it among known circumstances, we
may produce further variations of circumstances to any extent,
and of such kinds as we think best calculated to bring the laws of
the phenomenon into a clear light. By introducing one well-defined
circumstance after another into the experiment, we obtain assurance
<a name="page_400"><span class="page">Page 400</span></a> of the
manner in which the phenomenon behaves under an indefinite variety
of possible circumstances. Thus, chemists, after having obtained
some newly discovered substance in a pure state, ... introduce
various other substances, one by one, to ascertain whether it will
combine with them, or decompose them, and with what result; and
also apply heat or electricity or pressure, to discover what will
happen to the substance under each of these circumstances.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Logic</i> (London, 1872), vol. I, pp. 441-42.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Through experiment, we are thus enabled to observe the relation
of specific elements in a situation. We are, furthermore, enabled
to observe phenomena which are so rare in occurrence that it is
impossible to form generalizations from them or improbable that we
should even notice them: "We might have to wait years or centuries
to meet accidentally with facts which we can readily produce at
any moment in a laboratory; and it is probable that many of the
chemical substances now known, and many excessively useful products,
would never have been discovered at all, by waiting till Nature
presented them spontaneously to our observation." And phenomena,
such as that of electricity, which can only be understood when
the conditions of their occurrence are varied, are presented to
us in Nature most frequently in a fixed and invariable form.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Generalizations, their elaboration and testing.</b> So far we
have been concerned with the steps in the control of suggestion,
the re&euml;xamination of the facts so that significant suggestions
may be derived, and the elimination of the significant from the
insignificant in the elements of the situation as it first confronts
us. In logically elaborating a suggestion, as we have already seen,
we trace out the bearings of a given situation. We expand it; we see
what it <i>implies</i>, what it means. Thus, if we came, for example,
to a meeting that had been scheduled, and found no one present, we
might have several solutions arise in our minds. The meeting, we
might suppose, had been transferred to another room. If that were
the case, there would probably be some notice posted. In all cases
of deductive elaboration, we go through <a name="page_401"><span
class="page">Page 401</span></a> what might be called the If-Then
process. If <i>such-and-such</i> is the case, then <i>such-and-such</i>
will follow. We can then verify our suggested solution to a problem,
by going back to the facts, to see whether they correspond with the
implications of our suggestion. We may, to take another example,
think that a man who enters our office is an insurance agent, or
a book solicitor who had said he would call upon us at a definite
date. If such is the case, he will say such-and-such things. If
he does say them, then our suggestion is seen to be correct. The
advantages of developing a suggestion include the fact that some
link in the logical chain may bear a more obvious relation to our
problem than did the undeveloped suggestion itself.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The systematic sciences consist of such sets of principles so related
that any single term implies certain others, which imply certain
others and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After the facts have been elaborated, the generalization, however
plausible it may seem, must be subjected to experimental corroboration.
That is, if a suggestion is found through local elaboration to
mean <i>A, B, C</i>, then the situation must be re&euml;xamined to
see if the facts to be found tally with the facts deduced. In the
case cited, the suggestion that the man who entered the room was
the insurance agent we expected would be verified if he immediately
broached the subject and the fact, say, of a previous conversation.
In the case of disease, if the illness is typhoid, we shall find
certain specific conditions in the patient. If these are found,
the suggestion of typhoid is verified.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <i>reliability</i> of generalizations made by this scientific
procedure varies according to several factors. It varies, in the
first place, according to the correspondence of the predictions
made on the basis of the generalization, with subsequent events.
The reason we say the law of gravitation holds true is because in
every instance where observations or experiments have been made,
the results have tallied precisely with expectations based upon the
generalization. We can, to <a name="page_402"><span class="page">Page
402</span></a> a certain extent, determine the reliability of a
generalization before comparing our predictions with subsequent
events. If a generalization made contradicts laws that have been
established in so many instances that they are practically beyond
peradventure, it is suspect. A law, for example, that should be an
exception to the laws of motion or gravitation, is <i>a priori</i>
dubious.
</p>

<p class="include">
If an induction conflicts with stronger inductions, or with conclusions
capable of being correctly deduced from them, then, unless on
reconsideration it should appear that some of the stronger inductions
have been expressed with greater universality than their evidence
warrants, the weaker one must give way. The opinion so long prevalent
that a comet, or any other unusual appearance in the heavenly regions,
was the precursor of calamities to mankind, or to those at least
who witnessed it; the belief in the veracity of the oracles of
Delphi or Dodona; the reliance on astrology, or on the weather
prophecies in almanacs, were doubtless inductions supposed to be
grounded on experience.... What has really put an end to these
insufficient inductions is their inconsistency with the stronger
inductions subsequently obtained by scientific inquiry, respecting
the causes on which terrestrial events really depend.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The quantitative basis of scientific procedure.</b> Science
<i>is</i> science, some scientists insist, in so far as it is
mathematical. That is, in the precise determination of facts, and in
their repetition with a view to their exact determination, quantities
must be known. The sciences have developed in exactness, in so
far as they have succeeded in expressing their formulations in
numerical terms. The physical sciences, such as physics and chemistry,
which have been able to frame their generalizations from precise
quantities, have been immeasurably more certain and secure than
such sciences as psychology and sociology, where the measurement
of exact quantities is more difficult and rare. Jevons writes in
his <i>Principles of Science</i>:
</p>

<p class="include">
As physical science advances, it becomes more and more accurately
quantitative. Questions of simple logical fact resolve themselves
<a name="page_403"><span class="page">Page 403</span></a> after a
while into questions of degree, time, distance, or weight. Forces
hardly suspected to exist by one generation are clearly recognized
by the next, and precisely measured by the third generation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Jevons: <i>Principles of Science</i>, p. 270.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The history of science exhibits a constant progress from rude guesses
to precise measurement of quantities. In the earliest history of
astronomy there were attempts at quantitative determinations, very
crude, of course, in comparison with the exactness of present-day
scientific methods.
</p>

<p class="include">
Every branch of knowledge commences with quantitative notions of
a very rude character. After we have far progressed, it is often
amusing to look back into the infancy of the science, and contrast
present with past methods. At Greenwich Observatory in the present
day, the hundredth part of a second is not thought an inconsiderable
portion of time. The ancient Chaldreans recorded an eclipse to
the nearest hour, and the early Alexandrian astronomers thought
it superfluous to distinguish between the edge and center of the
sun. By the introduction of the astrolabe, Ptolemy, and the later
Alexandrian astronomers could determine the places of the heavenly
bodies within about ten minutes of arc. Little progress then ensued
for thirteen centuries, until Tycho Brahe made the first great
step toward accuracy, not only by employing better instruments,
but even more by ceasing to regard an instrument as correct....
He also took notice of the effects of atmospheric refraction, and
succeeded in attaining an accuracy often sixty times as great as
that of Ptolemy. Yet Tycho and Hevelius often erred several minutes
in the determination of a star's place, and it was a great achievement
of Roemer and Flamsteed to reduce this error to seconds. Bradley,
the modern Hipparchus, carried on the improvement, his errors in
right ascension, according to Bessel, being under one second of
time, and those of declination under four seconds of arc. In the
present day the average error of a single observation is probably
reduced to the half or the quarter of what it was in Bradley's
time; and further extreme accuracy is attained by the multiplication
of observations, and their skillful combination according to the
theory of error. Some of the more important constants... have been
determined within a tenth part of a second of space.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 271-72.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The precise measurement of quantities is important because we can,
in the first place, only through quantitative determinations be
sure we have made accurate observations, observations <a
name="page_404"><span class="page">Page 404</span></a> uncolored
by personal idiosyncrasies. Both errors of observation and errors
of judgment are checked up and averted by exact quantitative
measurements. The relations of phenomena, moreover, are so complex
that specific causes and effects can only be understood when they
are given precise quantitative determination. In investigating the
solubility of salts, for example, we find variability depending
on differences in temperature, pressure, the presence of other
salts already dissolved, and the like. The solubility of salt in
water differs again from its solubility in alcohol, ether, carbon,
bisulphide. Generalization about the solubility of salt, therefore,
depends on the exact measurement of the phenomenon under all these
conditions.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See Jevons, p, 279 ff.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The importance of exact measurement in scientific discovery and
generalization may be illustrated briefly from one instance in
the history of chemistry. The discovery of the chemical element
<i>argon</i> came about through some exact measurements by Lord
Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay of the nitrogen and the oxygen in
a glass flask. It was found that the nitrogen derived from air was
not altogether pure; that is, there were very minute differences
in the weighings of nitrogen made from certain of its compounds and
the weight obtained by removing oxygen, water, traces of carbonic
acid, and other impurities from the atmospheric air. It was found
that the very slightly heavier weight in one case was caused by
the presence of argon (about one and one third times as heavy as
nitrogen) and some other elementary gases. The discovery was here
clearly due to the accurate measurement which made possible the
discovery of this minute discrepancy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be noted in general that accuracy in measurement is immediately
dependent on the instruments of precision available. It has frequently
been pointed out that the Greeks, although incomparably fresh,
fertile, and direct in their thinking, yet made such a comparatively
slender contribution to scientific knowledge precisely because
they had no instruments for exact measurement. The thermometer
made possible the <a name="page_405"><span class="page">Page
405</span></a> science of heat. The use of the balance has been
in large part responsible for advances in chemistry.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The degree to which sciences have attained quantitative accuracy
varies among the physical sciences. The phenomena of light are
not yet subject to accurate measurement; many natural phenomena
have not yet been made the subject of measurement at all. Such
are the intensity of sound, the phenomena of taste and smell, the
magnitude of atoms, the temperature of the electric spark or of
the sun's atmosphere.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See Jevons, p. 273.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sciences tend, in general, to become more and more quantitative.
All phenomena "exist in space and involve molecular movements,
measurable in velocity and extent." The ideal of all sciences is
thus to reduce all phenomena to measurements of mass and motion.
This ideal is obviously far from being attained. Especially in
the social sciences are quantitative measurements difficult, and
in these sciences we must remain therefore at best in the region
of shrewd guesses or fairly reliable probability.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Statistics and probability.</b> While in the social sciences,
exact quantitative measurements are difficult, they are to an extent
possible, and to the extent that they are possible we can arrive
at fairly accurate generalizations as to the probable occurrence
of phenomena. There are many phenomena where the elements are so
complex that they cannot be analyzed and invariable causal relations
established.
</p>

<p class="include">
In a study of the phenomena of the weather, for example, the phenomena
are so exceedingly complex that anything approaching a complete
statement of their elements is quite out of the question. The
fallibility of most popular generalizations in these fields is
evidence of the difficulty of dealing with such facts. Must we be
content then simply to guess at such phenomena? ... In instances
of this sort, another method ... becomes important: The Method of
Statistics. In statistics we have an <i>exact</i> enumeration of
cases. If a small number of cases does not enable us to detect the
causal relations of a phenomenon, it sometimes happens that a large
number, <a name="page_406"><span class="page">Page 406</span></a>
accurately counted, and taken from a field widely extended in time
and space, will lead to a solution of the problem.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Jones; <i>Logic, Inductive and Deductive</i>, p. 190.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
If we find, in a wide variety of instances, two phenomena occurring
in a certain constant correlation, we infer a causal relation. If
the variations in the frequency of one correspond to variations
in the frequency of the other, there is probability of more than
connection by coincidence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The correlation between phenomena may be measured mathematically;
it is possible to express in figures the exact relations between
the occurrence of one phenomenon and the occurrence of another.
The number which expresses this relation is called the coefficient
of correlation. This coefficient expresses relationship in terms
of the mean values of the two series of phenomena by measuring the
amount each individual phenomenon varies from its respective mean.
Suppose, for example, that in correlating crime and unemployment,
the coefficient of correlation were found to be .47. If in every
case of unemployment crime were found and in every case of crime,
unemployment, the coefficient of correlation would be +1. If crime
were never found in unemployment, and unemployment never in crime,
the coefficient of correlation would be -1, indicating a perfect
inverse relationship. A coefficient of 0 would indicate that there
is no relationship. The coefficient of .47 would accordingly indicate
a significant but not a "high" correlation between crime and
unemployment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We cannot consider here all the details of statistical methods, but
attention may be called to a few of the more significant features
of the process. Statistics is a science, and consists in much more
than the mere counting of cases.
</p>

<p class="include">
With the collection of statistical data, only the first step has
been taken. The statistics in that condition are only raw material
showing nothing. They are not an instrument of investigation any
more than a kiln of bricks is a monument of architecture. They
need to <a name="page_407"><span class="page">Page 407</span></a>
be arranged, classified, tabulated, and brought into connection
with other statistics by the statistician. Then only do they become
an instrument of investigation, just as a tool is nothing more
than a mass of wood or metal, except in the hands of a skilled
workman.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mayo-Smith: <i>Statistics and Sociology</i>, p. 18.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The essential steps in a statistical investigation are: (1) the
collection of material, (2) its tabulation, (3) the summary, and
(4) a critical examination of the results. The terms are almost
self-explanatory. There are, however, several general points of
method to be noted.
</p>

In the collection of data a wide field must be covered, to be sure
that we are dealing with invariable relations instead of with mere
coincidences, "or overemphasizing the importance of one out of a
number of co&ouml;perating causes." Tabulation of the data collected
is very important, since classification of the data does much to
suggest the causal relations sought. The headings under which data
will be collected depend on the purposes of the investigation. In
general, statistics can suggest generalizations, rather than establish
them. They indicate probability, not invariable relation.[2]

<b>Science as an instrument of human progress.</b> We have, in an
earlier section of this chapter, referred to the practical value
of science. "Man's power of deliberate control of his own affairs
depends upon ability to direct energies to use; an ability which is,
in turn, dependent upon insight into nature's processes. Whatever
natural science may be for the specialist,... it is knowledge of the
conditions of human action."[3] And the wider, the more complete
and the more penetrating our knowledge of the world in which we
live, the more extended become the boundaries of human action.
Through a knowledge of natural processes, men have passed from
a frightened subjection to Nature to its conscious control. And
the fruits of that control are, as we have already had occasion to
notice, all-pervading in practical life. That complete transformation
of life known as the Industrial Revolution, <a name="page_408"><span
class="page">Page 408</span></a> which came about with such swiftness
and completeness in the early nineteenth century, and whose effects
have not yet ceased to accumulate, was the direct outcome of the
application of the experimental science which had begun in the
sixteenth. Some of the consequences of the application of theoretical
investigation to practical life have already been noted. There
are first the more obvious facts of the inventions, great and
small&mdash;the railways, steamships, electric transportation,
automobiles, and telephones&mdash;which have changed in countless
details our daily life. There are the profound and all-pervasive
changes which have been brought about in industrial and social
relations: the building-up of our vast industrial centers, the change
from small-scale handicrafts to large-scale machine production, the
factory system, with its concomitants of immensely increased resources
and immensely complicated problems of human life. Science in the
short span of three centuries has shown how rapid and immediate
could be the fruits of human control of Nature, and its further
fruits are incalculable.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: Dewey: <i>Democracy and Education</i>, p. 267.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science has indeed already begun to affect men's attitude towards
experience as well as their material progress. It is only when
men set out with the conscious realization that intelligence does
make a difference in the world, that science becomes articulate.
Science is the guarantee of progress. It has shown men that the
future is to some extent in their own hands; that by dint of a
laborious and detailed application of intelligence to the processes
of nature, those processes can be controlled in the interests of
human welfare.
</p>

<p class="include">
Science has led men to look to the future instead of the past. The
coincidence of the ideal of progress with the advance of science
is not a mere coincidence. Before this advance men placed the golden
age in remote antiquity. Now they face the future with a firm belief
that intelligence properly used can do away with evils once thought
inevitable. To subjugate devastating disease is no longer a dream;
the hope of abolishing poverty is not Utopian.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_409"><span class="page">Page 409</span></a> But science
may be used for any end. It reveals the relations of phenomena,
relations which hold for all men. It shows what causes are connected
with what consequents, and, as already pointed out, in the knowledge
of causes lies the possible control of effects. We can secure the
results we desire, by discovering what antecedents must first be
established. Science is thus a fund of common resources. Specific
causes are revealed to be connected with specific effects, and men,
by making a choice of antecedents, can secure the consequences
they desire. But which effects they will desire depends on the
instincts, standards, and habits of the individual, and the traditions
and ideals of the group. A knowledge of chemistry may be used for
productive industrial processes, or in the invention of poison
gas. Expert acquaintance with psychology and educational methods
may be used to impress upon a nation an arbitrary type of life
(an accusation justly brought against the Prussian educational
system), or to promote the specific possibilities that each individual
displays.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not only are the fruits of scientific inquiry used in different
ways by different individuals and groups, but scientific inquiry is
itself affected by the prevailing interests and mode of life. What
inquiries shall be furthered depends on <i>what</i> the individual or
group feels it important to know. From a social point of view, certain
scientific developments are of more urgency and imperativeness than
others. During an emergency, as during the Great War, it might be
necessary to turn all the energies of scientific men into immediately
productive pursuits. And, since the pursuit of inquiry on a large
scale demands large resources, those researches which give promise
of beneficent human consequences will the more readily command
social sanction and approval and will be developed at the expense
of more remote speculations however intrinsically interesting these
latter may be.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science has proved so valuable a human instrument that it has attained
a moral responsibility. Men have increasingly come to realize that
the pressing problems of our industrial <a name="page_410"><span
class="page">Page 410</span></a> life require for their solution
not the confusions and incompetences of passion and prejudice,
but an application of the fruits of scientific inquiry. Science
has already so completely demonstrated its vast fruitfulness in
human welfare, that it must be watched with jealous vigilance. It
must result as it began, in the improvement of human welfare.[1]
But what constitutes human welfare is a question which leads us
into the final activity of the Career of Reason, Morals and Moral
Valuation, man's attempt to determine what happiness is, and how
he may attain it.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: We have already noted the danger of too complete a
commitment of science to immediately practical results. This narrows
instead of broadening possibility. As Mr. F. P. Keppel points out
in a recent article, "Scholarship in War" (<i>Columbia University
Quarterly</i>, July, 1919), some of the most important and immediately
practical contributions during the Great War came from the ranks
of those who would be regarded as "pure theorists."]

CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="subtitle">MORALS AND MORAL VALUATION</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The pre-conditions of morality&mdash;Instinct, impulse, and
desire.</b> In Art and Science, man attempts to transform the world
of nature into conditions more in conformity with his desires. In
the enterprise of Morals, man attempts to discover how to control
his own nature in the attainment of happiness. We have already had
occasion to see that Art, in the broad sense of human contrivance,
is made necessary by the incongruity between nature and human nature.
We shall examine now the conditions which make it necessary and make
it possible for man to consider and to control those elementary
impulses with which he is endowed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The origin of the moral problem will become clearer after a brief
recapitulation of those elements of original nature which form the
basis of all human action. We have seen that human beings are equipped,
apart from education or training, with certain tendencies to act in
certain definite ways, given certain definite stimuli. Any single
activity of an average human being in a modern civilized community
is compounded of so many modifications of original tendencies to
action that these latter seem often altogether obliterated. The
conditions of civilized life, moreover, place continual checks
on the free activity of any given impulse, and there are so many
stimuli playing upon an individual at once that the responses called
out tend to inhibit each other. The particular thing we say to an
acquaintance we happen to meet is not determined by a single original
impulse, by love or hate, fear or sympathy, pugnacity or pity. It
is a compound of some or of most of these. On the other hand, no
matter how complicated or sophisticated human action becomes, it is
built out of these same impulses, which were <a name="page_412"><span
class="page">Page 412</span></a> operative when human beings had not
yet passed out of savagery. We may check and control our responses
through habitual repressions, through deliberate forethought, through
conscious or mechanical acquiescence in the ways of the group among
which we live. But these original impulses are still the mainspring
of our activities.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The complex, highly artificial character of our civilization often
obscures the presence of these powerful instinctive tendencies,
but that they <i>are</i> present and powerful several facts bear
witness. They manifest themselves, as the newer psychology of the
subconscious has repeatedly pointed out, in roundabout ways; they
are, in the technical phrase, sublimated. Instincts find, as it
were, substitute realizations. This process of sublimation of
unfulfilled desire has been noted particularly with regard to the
sex instinct, but the principle applies to the others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The continual suppression of instincts results in various forms of
morbidity, in what Graham Wallas calls "baulked dispositions." To
say that instincts are repressed, is to say there is a maladjustment
between the individual as he comes into the world, and the world
as he finds it. This maladjustment may vary in intensity. It may
be exhibited in nothing more serious than boredom, or petulance,
or hyper-sensitiveness. It may be a chronic sense of not fitting
in, of being lost in a blind alley. One has but to review one's
list of acquaintances to see how many people there are who feel
somehow frustrated in the work they happen to be doing, who feel
themselves inexplicably at odds with the world. Graham Wallas well
describes the situation when he writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
For we cannot in Saint Paul's sense mortify our dispositions. If
they are not stimulated, they do not therefore die, nor is the
human being what he would be if they had never existed. If we leave
unstimulated, or, to use a shorter term, if we "baulk" any one of
our main dispositions, Curiosity, Property, Trial and Error, Sex,
and the rest, we produce in ourselves a state of nervous strain.
It may be desirable in any particular case of conduct that we should
do so, but we ought to know what we are doing.
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_413"><span class="page">Page 413</span></a> The baulking
of each disposition produces its own type of strain; but the
distinctions between the types are, so far, unnamed and unrecognized,
and a trained psychologist would do a real service to civilized
life if he would carefully observe and describe them.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Wallas: <i>The Great Society</i>, p. 65.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The presence of instinctive activities is seen in stark immediacy
and directness every now and then in civilized life. Lynchings and
mob violence in general are illustrations of what happens when
groups throw to the winds the multiple inhibitions of custom and
law. And the records of the criminal courts exhibit more cases
than are commonly realized of sheer crimes of violence. In some
instances these can be set down as pathological, but in many more
they are normal instincts breaking through the fixed channels set by
public opinion, tradition, and legal compulsion. On a smaller scale
an outburst of anger, a fit of temper, sulk or spleen, exhibits the
enduring though often obscured presence of instinctive tendencies
in civilized life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The conflict of interests between men and groups.</b> How comes
it, then, that men whose whole activity is a complication of these
powerful original tendencies to action should not follow these
native impulses freely? The answer is that men not only live, but
live together. Wherever human wants, as in any group, even a small
one, must be filled through cooperation, accommodation, compromise,
give-and-take, adjustment must be made. "Man," to adapt Kant's
phrase, "cannot get on with his fellows; and he cannot get on without
them." Other men are necessary to help us fulfill our desires, and
yet our desires conflict with theirs. The dual fact of cooperation
and conflict is, in a sense, the root of the moral problem. How
is one individual to attain happiness without at the same time
interfering with the happiness of others? How can the desires with
which all men come into the world be fulfilled for all men?
</p>

<p class="indent">
The adjustment of these problems is at once complicated and facilitated
by the fact that one of man's most powerful <a name="page_414"><span
class="page">Page 414</span></a> native desires is, as we have already
seen, his desire to please other men. This extreme sensitivity to
the praise and blame of his fellows operates powerfully to qualify
men's other instincts. The ruthlessness with which men might otherwise
fulfill their desires is checked by the fact that within themselves
there is a conflict between the desire to win other sorts of
gratification, and the desire to win the praise of others and to
avoid their blame. This is simply one instance of what we shall
have occasion presently to note, that not only is there a conflict
between men in the fulfillment of their native instincts, but within
individuals an adjustment must be made between competing impulses
themselves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The kinds of conflict that occur between men in the fulfillment of
their original native tendencies, are as various as those tendencies
and their combinations. It may be a conflict, as in primitive life,
between individuals seeking food from the same source. It may be a
clash in the pursuit of one form or another of self-enhancement,
enhancement which can come to only some individual out of a group.
The sex instinct has afforded, in the case of the "eternal triangle,"
an example of the sharing by two people of an imperious desire
for precisely the same object of satisfaction. These conflicts
of interest are an inevitable result of the constitution of human
nature. It is perfectly natural that human beings constituted with
largely identical impulses should not infrequently seek identical
satisfactions. Groups as well as individuals may come into collision,
and for analogous reasons. Class divisions over the distribution
of wealth, international wars over the distribution of territory,
are sufficiently familiar examples.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The levels of moral action&mdash;Custom&mdash;The establishment
of "folkways."</b> No anthropologist seems to have discovered anywhere
individuals living totally alone or in total oblivion to the needs
or interests of others. The human necessity for co&ouml;peration and
the human desire for companionship bring individuals together. And
individuals, once living <a name="page_415"><span class="page">Page
415</span></a> together, find some <i>modus vivendi</i>. Adjustments
are, in general, effected through established and authoritative
"folkways."[1] That is, certain acts come to be recognized as sanctioned
or as disapproved by the group. And these sanctions or disapprovals
are powerful in the control of human action. The fact that individuals
live and must live together is thus the surest guarantee that they
will not, once they have grown old enough to communicate with other
people, altogether follow their immediate capricious desires.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Professor Sumner's convenient term.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The reason for the power of social approvals and disapprovals over
individuals lies partly in the fact, already noted, of the human
being's extremely high sensitivity to the praise and blame of others.
But part of the explanation is social rather than psychological. Even
primitive tribes take special pains to make public and pervasive
the commands and prohibitions which have become affixed to given
acts. The mere fact that an act <i>is</i> customary is itself a
sufficiently strong guarantee that it will be practiced, since the
human being tends to perform, as he likes to perform, the habitual.
But in primitive life, the enforcement of custom is not left to the
influence of habit. The prohibitions and sanctions, both in savage
and in civilized society, are made into law. In the former instance,
there are most elaborate devices and institutions for enforcing the
traditional approvals and disapprovals. Tabus are one important
instrument of the enforcement of social checks upon individual
action; "tabus are perhaps not so much a means for enforcing custom
as they are themselves customs invested with peculiar and awful
sanction. They prohibit or ban any contact with certain persons or
objects under penalty of danger from unseen beings."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Through ritual certain acts come to be performed with great regularity,
thoroughness, detail, and solemnity. "In primitive life it [ritual] is
widely and effectively used to insure for educational, political, and
domestic customs obedience to <a name="page_416"><span class="page">Page
416</span></a> the group standards." In contemporary life, certain
social forms and observances, as well as certain religious ceremonies,
are examples of the enforcement of given acts, by ritual.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Praise and blame are equally effective enforcements of certain
types of action and of the avoidance of others. In primitive life,
praise is as likely as not to take the form of art&mdash;decorations,
costumes, songs, and tattoos. In modern life, as we have seen,
praise and blame take the form of public opinion, as expressed
by friends, acquaintances, newspapers, and the like.[1] Praise
and blame are not so fixed and rigid in civilized communities;
individuals move freely among diverse groups whose standards differ.
But group approval is none the less effective.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See page 106.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In primitive life and, though less patently, in contemporary society,
physical force is the ultimate power for enforcing custom. Primitive
chiefs are usually the strong men of the tribes; and behind law
in modern social organization is the physical power of the State
to enforce it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Morality as conformity to the established.</b> The beginning
of morals is thus to be found in conformity to the established or
customary. The criterion of morality is compliance&mdash;compliance
with the regular, the socially approved, the common (that is, the
communal) ways of action. Apart from the consequences of violation,
violation <i>per se</i> is impure, unholy, immoral. The terms are,
in some cases, interchangeable. In primitive life, violations are
regarded with particular horror, because they are frequently held
to be not only infringements of established ways of the tribe, but
as offenses against the gods, offenses which involve the whole
tribe in the retributive punishments of the gods. Violation of the
customary may, indeed, apart from arousing intellectual disapproval,
provoke a genuine revulsion of feeling on the part of a group which
has acquired certain fixed habits. We still feel emotionally shocked
by the infringement of a custom that we do not intellectually value
highly. If we examine our <a name="page_417"><span class="page">Page
417</span></a> moral furniture we find it made up of an immense
number of early acquired inhibitions or "checks." These not only
prevent us from violating, at least without qualms, standards to which
we have early been trained; they make deviations or irregularities
on the part of others appear as "immoral," even before or without
our intellectually classifying them as such. There are adults, for
example, who cannot outgrow the feeling to which they have early
been habituated, that card-playing at any time, or baseball-playing
on Sunday, is "evil," even though they are no longer intellectually
affected by scruples in those respects. There is significance in
the fact that by speaking of "irregularities" in a man's conduct,
we signify. or imply moral disapproval.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The group, in any stage of civilization, rewards in some form conformity
to group standards, and punishes infringements of them. Punishment
may be nothing more tangible than disrepute or ostracism; it may
be as serious as execution. Reward may range from a decoration
or a chorus of praise to all forms of compensation in the way of
wealth, rank, and power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have noted how sanctions and prohibitions are made public and
effective among the members of a group. But it is further regarded
as important by the group that these customs, positive and negative,
should be handed down from the current to succeeding generations.
In primitive life transmission of the traditional practices is made
a very special occasion in the form of initiation ceremonies.
</p>

<p class="include">
[Initiation ceremonies] are held with the purpose of inducting
boys into the privileges of manhood and into the full life of the
group. They are calculated at every step to impress upon the initiate
his own ignorance and helplessness in contrast with the wisdom
and power of the group; and as the mystery with which they are
conducted imposes reverence for the elders and the authorities
of the group, so the recital of the traditions and performances
of the tribe, the long series of ritual acts, common participation
in the mystic dance and song and decorations, serve to reinforce
the ties that bind the tribe.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey and Tufts: <i>Ethics</i>, pp. 57-58.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_418"><span class="page">Page 418</span></a> In civilized
life, the whole institution of education, as has been repeatedly
emphasized in these pages, is designed to transmit to the young
those habits of thought, feeling, and action which their influential
elders wish to perpetuate. As was noted in connection with man's
gregariousness, the normal becomes the "respectable," the regular
becomes the "proper." We still speak of things that it is not "nice"
to do. This tendency to identify the moral with the customary is
brought about through early habituating the members of the group
to the group standards and securing for them thereby the emotional
support that goes with all habitual action.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Morality at this stage is clearly social in its origins and its
operations. The standards are group standards, and the individual's
single duty is obedience and conformity to the established social
sanctions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The values of customary morality.</b> The problem of morals
begins, as we have seen, in the collision of interests of similarly
constituted individuals living together. Adjustments of conflicting
interests are effected by group standards more or less consciously
transmitted and enforced by education, public opinion, and law.
We shall note presently that reflection operates to modify and
criticize these customary approvals and disapprovals and to substitute
more effective standards. But whether on the level of custom or
reflection, the moral problem is essentially a <i>social</i> problem,
the problem of the adjustment of the desires of individuals living
together. For an individual living altogether alone in the world
there could hardly be a moral problem, a question of "ought." There
might be problems of how to attain satisfaction, but no sense of
duty or moral obligation. Custom is the first great stage through
which morality passes, and the only form in which morality exists
for many people. In civilized life there is, to be sure, considerable
reflection and querying of custom, but for the vast majority of
men "right" and "wrong" are determined by the standards to which
their early education <a name="page_419"><span class="page">Page
419</span></a> and environment have accustomed them. In primitive
life, reflective criticism on the part of the individual is almost
unknown, and custom remains the great arbiter of action, the outstanding
source of social and moral control.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The values of custom as a moral force are, in both primitive and
civilized life, notable and not to be despised. Custom is, in the
first place, frequently rational in its origin. That is, in general,
those acts are made habitual in the group which are associated
with the general welfare. The customary is the "right," but those
activities most frequently come to be regarded as "right" which
are favorable to the welfare of the group. In the literal struggle
for existence which characterizes primitive life, those tribes may
alone be expected to survive whose customs do promote the welfare of
their members. Persistence by a group in customs like infanticide or
excessive restriction of population will result in their extinction.
Customs are, for the most part, standards of action established in
the light of the conceptions of well-being as understood at the
time of their origin. The intensity with which they are maintained,
enforced, and transmitted is an indication of how supremely and
practically important they are regarded by primitive groups.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Custom is valuable, if for nothing else, in the fact that it makes
possible some accommodation or adjustment of competing individual
interests&mdash;and on the basis of a widely considered social
welfare. Customs are <i>social</i>, they are binding on all; they
apply to all, and to the extent that they do promote welfare, they
promote, within limits, the welfare of all. A man conforming to
custom is thereby consulting something other than his arbitrary
caprice or personal desire. On the level of customary morality,
action through conformity to custom is referred to a wider context
than unconsidered individual impulse; it is, for better or worse,
performed with reference to the group with whose standards it is in
conformity. It is the beginning of the socialization of human interests.
Though unconsciously, the man conforming <a name="page_420"><span
class="page">Page 420</span></a> to a custom is considering his
fellows, and the values and traditions which have become current
among them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Customs, moreover, are the first invasion of moral chaos. They
establish enduring standards; they give common and permanent bases
of action. It is only through the establishment and transmission
of customary standards that one generation is in any way superior
to its predecessors. Customs, in civilized life, include all the
established effective ways of civilization, its arts, its sciences,
its industries, and its useful modes of co&ouml;peration.
</p>

<p class="include">
If a plague carried off the members of a society all at once, it
is obvious that the group would be permanently done for. Yet the
death of each of its constituent members is as certain as if a
plague took them off all at once. But the graded difference in age,
the fact that some are born as some die, makes possible through
transmission of ideas and practices the constant reweaving of the
social fabric. Yet this renewal is not automatic. Unless pains are
taken to see that genuine and thorough transmission takes place,
the most civilized group will relapse into barbarism and then into
savagery.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>Democracy and Education</i>, p. 4.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In all levels of civilization, there is a conscious transmission
of those social habits which are regarded as of importance. If this
transmission were suddenly to cease, not only would each generation
have to start afresh, but it would be altogether impossible for it
to grow to maturity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The defects of customary morality.</b> While custom is thus
valuable as a moral agent in establishing standards of social life
and rendering them continuous and enduring, a morality that is
completely based upon it has serious defects. Though customs may
start as allegedly or actually useful practices, they tend, so
strong is the influence of habit over the individual, to outlive
their usefulness, and may become, indeed, altogether disadvantageous
conventions. "Dr. Arthur Smith tells of the advantage it would be
in some parts of China to build a door on the south side of the
house, in order to get the breeze, in hot weather." The simple and
sufficient <a name="page_421"><span class="page">Page 421</span></a>
answer to such a suggestion is, "We don't build doors on the south
side."
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have but to examine our own civilization to see that there are
many customs which are practiced not for any good assignable reason,
but simply because they have become fixed and traditional. This is
not to say that everything that has become "merely conventional"
is evil. It is to suggest how, even in civilized society, groups
may fall into modes of action that are practiced simply because
they <i>have been</i> practiced, rather than from any reasoned
consideration that they <i>should</i> be. An illustration may be
taken from the experience of civilians drawn into the military
routine during the Great War. Men engaged in war work at Washington
in civilian capacities reported repeatedly their impatience at the
"red tape" of tradition with which certain classes of business were
conducted by the military establishment. In law also, progressive
practitioners and students have pointed out the well-known fact of
the immense and beclogging ritual which has come to surround legal
procedure. It is the contention of critics of one or another of our
contemporary social habits and institutions that traditionalism,
the persistence of custom simply because it <i>is</i> custom, is
responsible for many of the anachronisms in our social, political, and
industrial life. Space does not permit here a detailed consideration
of this question, but it must be noted that social habits, when they
are acquired, as they are, unreflectively by the vast majority
of people, will tend to be repeated and supported, apart from any
consideration of their consequences. This tendency toward social
inertia, earlier noted in connection with habit, can only be checked
by reflective criticism and appraisement of our current accustomed
ways of action.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: See chapter on "Cultural Continuity."]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the case of the group, too complete a domination by custom is
dangerous in that it sanctions and promotes the continuance of
habits that have become useless or harmful. <a name="page_422"><span
class="page">Page 422</span></a> In the case of the individual, the
determination of action by custom alone has its specific dangers
and defects. Even though the individual happens to conform to useful
customs, his conformity is purely mechanical. It involves no intelligent
discrimination. Merely to conform places one at the disposition of
the environment in which one chances to be. There is not necessary
any intelligent analysis on the part of the agent, of the bearings
and consequences of his actions. He takes on with fatal facility
the color of his environment. To all men, however critical and
reflective, a certain degree of conformity to custom is both necessary
and useful. There must, in any social enterprise, be some common
basis of action. Because taking the right-hand side of the road
is a convention, it is none the less a useful one. But reflective
acquiescence in a custom differs from merely mechanical conformity.
It transforms a custom from a blind mechanism into a consciously
chosen instrument for achieving good.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The trivial and the important in a morality based upon custom receive
the same unconsidered support. "Tithing mint, anise, and cummin
are quite likely to involve the neglect of weightier matters of
the law." Physical, emotional, and moral energies that should be
devoted to matters genuinely affecting human welfare are lavished
upon the trivial and the incidental. We may come to be concerned
more with manners than with morals; with ritual, than with right.
Customary morality tends to emphasize, moreover, the letter rather
than the spirit of the law. It implies complete and punctilious
obedience, meticulous conformity. It emphasizes form rather than
content. Since conformity is the only criterion, the appearance
of conformity is all that is required. The individual may fear to
dissent openly rather than actually. This is seen frequently in
the ritualistic performance or fulfillment of a duty in all its
external details, rather than the actual and positive performance
of its content. It is just such Pharisaism that is protested against
in the Sermon on the Mount:
</p>

<p class="include">
<a name="page_423"><span class="page">Page 423</span></a> And when
thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they
love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the
streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have their reward....
</p>

<p class="include">
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do; for
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Formalism in morality has periodically roused protest from the
Prophets down, and formalism is the result of an unconsidered mechanical
acquiescence in custom, or deliberate insistence on traditional
details when the spirit and motive are forgotten.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Custom and progress.</b> Emphasis upon customs as already established
tends to promote fixity and repetition, and to discourage change
regardless of the benefits to be derived from specific changes.
Custom is supported by the group merely because it is custom; and
the ineffective modes of life are maintained along with those which
are more useful. Progress comes about through individual variation,
and conformity and individual variation are frequently in diametrical
collision. It is only when, in Bagehot's phrase, "the cake of custom"
is broken, that changes making for good have a possibility of
introduction and support. Where the only moral sanctions are the
sanctions of custom, change of whatever sort is at a discount.
For change implies deviation from the ways of life sanctioned by
the group, and deviation is itself, in a custom-bound morality,
regarded with suspicion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is clear that complete conformity is impossible save in a society
of automata. There will be some individuals who will not be able
to curb their desires to fit the inhibitions fixed by the group;
there will be some who will deliberately stand out against the
group commands and prohibitions, and assert their own imperious
impulses against their fellows. Where such men are powerful or
persuasive they may indeed bring about a transvaluation of all
values; they may create a new morality. There are geniuses of the
moral as well <a name="page_424"><span class="page">Page 424</span></a>
as the intellectual life, whose sudden insight becomes a standard
for succeeding generations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There may, again, be more infringement of the moral code than is
overtly noticeable. Frequently, as in a Puritanical r&eacute;gime,
there may be, along with fanatic public professions and practice
of virtue, private violation of the conventional moral codes. Our
civilization is unpleasantly decorated with countless examples of
this discrepancy between professed and practiced codes. The desire
for praise and the fear of blame and its consequences, the desire,
as we say, for the "good-will" and "respect of others," will lead
to all the public manifestations of virtue, "with a private vice
or two to appease the wayward flesh." The utterance of conventional
moral formulas by men in public, and the infringement of those high
doctrines in private, needs unfortunately not to be illustrated.
Moli&egrave;re drew Tartuffe from real life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Origin and nature of reflective morality.</b> If the customs
current were adequate to adjust men to their environment, reflection
upon them might never arise. Reflection does arise precisely because
customs are not, or do not remain, adequate. An individual is brought
up to believe that certain actions are good, and that their performance
promotes human happiness. He discovers, by an alert and unclouded
insight, that in specific cases the virtues highly regarded by his
group do not bring the felicitous results which they are commonly
and proverbially held to produce. He observes, let us say, that
meekness, humility, honesty are not modes of adaptation that bring
happy results. He observes, as Job observed, that the wicked prosper;
he notes that those who follow the path called righteous bring
unhappiness to themselves and to others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Or the individual's first reflection upon moral standards may arise
in his discovery that moral standards are not absolute, that what is
virtue in the Occident is vice in the Orient, and <i>vice versa</i>.
He discovers that those actions which he regards as virtuous are
so regarded by him simply because <a name="page_425"><span
class="page">Page 425</span></a> he has been trained to their
acceptance. Given another environment, his moral revulsions and
approvals might be diametrically reversed. He makes the discovery
that Protagoras made two thousand years ago: "Man is the measure
of all things"; standards of good and evil depend on the accidents
of time, space, and circumstance. In such a discovery an individual
may well query, What <i>is</i> the good? Not what passes for good,
but what is the essence of goodness? What is justice? Not what is
accredited justice in the courts of law, or in the market-place, or
in the easy generalizations of common opinion. But what constitutes
<i>justice</i> essentially? What is the <i>standard</i> by which
actions may be rated just and unjust?
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where individuals are habituated to one single tradition or set
of customs, such questions may not arise. But where one, through
personal experience or acquaintance with history and literature,
discovers the multiplicity of standards which have been current
with regard to the just and the good in human conduct, the search
for some reasonable standard arises. The great historical instance
of the discovery of the relativity and irrationality of customary
morality and the emergence of reflective standards of moral value
is the Athenian period of Greek philosophy. The Sophists pointed out
with merciless perspicuity the welter, the confusion, the essential
irrationality of current social and religious traditions and beliefs.
They went no further in moral analysis than destructive criticism.
They pointed out the want of authenticity or reason in the traditional
morality by which men lived. Socrates went a step further. If current
customs are not authoritative, he said, let us find those that
have and <i>ought</i> to have enduring authority over men. If the
traditional standards are proved to be futile and inefficacious,
let us find the unfaltering standards authenticated by reason.
Let us substitute relevant and adequate codes and creeds for those
which have by reason been shown to be unreasonable. Beneath the
multiplicity of contradictory and often vicious <a name="page_426"><span
class="page">Page 426</span></a> customs, reason must be able to
discover ways of life, which, if followed, will lead men to eventual
happiness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are thus two stages in the process of reflection upon morals.
In the first stage reflection does no more than to point out the
essential discrepancies and absurdities of the current moral codes.
Reflection upon morals begins by being critical and querying. It
starts when an individual, a little more thoughtful and perspicacious
than his fellows, notes the discrepancies between the customs of
different men, and notes also the discrepancies between the threatened
results of the violation of traditional codes and the actual results.
He may then come to the cynic's conclusion that morality is a myth
and a delusion, and, in the words of the Sophist in Plato's
<i>Republic</i>, "justice is merely the right of the stronger."
Men in whom reflection or social sympathy extends not very far may,
as they frequently do, stop at this point. These are the worldly
wise; they are interested not in goodness, truth, and justice,
but in those effective representations of those things publicly
accounted good, true, and just which will win them public approval
and increase their own wealth or power and position. Plato, in
the <i>Republic</i>, pictures the type with magnificent irony:
</p>

<p class="include">
All those mercenary adventurers who, as we know, are called sophist
by the multitude, and regarded as rivals, really teach nothing but
the opinions of the majority to which expression is given when
large masses are collected, and dignify them with the title of
wisdom. As well might a person investigate the caprices and desires
of some huge and powerful monster in his keeping, studying how
it is to be approached, and how handled,&mdash;at what times and
under what circumstances it becomes most dangerous, or most
gentle&mdash;on what occasions it is in the habit of uttering its
various cries, and further, what sounds uttered by another person
soothe or exasperate it,&mdash;and when he has mastered all these
particulars, by long-continued intercourse, as well might he call
his results wisdom, systematize them into an art, and open a school,
though in reality he is wholly ignorant which of these humours
and desires is fair, and which foul, which good and which evil,
which just and which unjust; and therefore is content to affix all
these names to the fancies of the huge <a name="page_427"><span
class="page">Page 427</span></a> animal, calling what it likes good,
and what it dislikes evil, without being able to render any other
account of them,&mdash;nay, giving the titles of "just" and "fair" to
things done under compulsion, because he has not discerned himself,
and therefore cannot point out to others, that wide distinction
which really holds between the nature of the compulsory and the
good.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Plato: <i>Republic</i> (Golden Treasury edition), pp.
209-10.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Throughout human history, there have been periods of individualism,
of self-assertion against the traditional morality, which have
been marked by loss of moral restraints, by a breakdown of the old
standards without a substitution of new and sounder ones. There
has been, in the beginning of almost every advance toward a new
stage of moral valuation, the accompaniment of liberty by license.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reflection upon morals is not likely to produce immediately good
results. The established morality is at least established. In so
far as it is controlling in men's actions, it keeps those actions
ordered and regular. The traditional code by which a man's life
is governed may be a poor code, but it is more satisfactory than
no code at all. On discovering the inadequacy of the morality by
which he has lived, a man may reject morality altogether. From
that time forth he may have no other standard than his own selfish
desires. When a whole society, as at the time of the Renaissance,
throws its traditional morality to the winds, it may make havoc of
its freedom. In place of a bad moral order it may cease to have
any moral order at all.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discovery that the codes by which we have lived are misleading
and delusive may lead us to have nothing whatsoever to do with
morals. The individual may decide simply to employ his superior
insight in the exploitation of other people. It is something of
this point of view that is expressed in the rampant individualism
of Nietzsche and Max Stirner. The customary morality is meant for
slaves; the Superman must stride above the signs and shibboleths
by which men are led, and create himself a morality more adequate
to his own superb and insolent welfare.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_428"><span class="page">Page 428</span></a> For the
reconstruction of a morality more adequate than the prevailing codes,
more is demanded than merely a reflective criticism of prevailing
standards. Where reflection goes no further than this, the net
result is merely cynicism and libertinism. For moral progress there
is needed "a person who is individual in choice, in feeling, in
responsibility, and at the same time social in what he regards
as good, in his sympathies and in his purposes."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflective reconstruction of moral standards.</b> The second
stage of reflection upon morals consists in the reconstruction of
moral standards, in a deliberate discovery of codes by which men
can live together happily. It attempts to establish standards of
action which are enforced and recommended not because they have been
current and are currently approved, but because they give promise,
upon critical examination, of contributing to human happiness. It
must be recalled here that reflective morality is not a substitute
for action based upon instinct or custom. It merely modifies these
types of action in the light of the desirable consequences which
would result from such modification.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The establishment of reflective standards is limited by two general
conditions. The first, previously mentioned, is that human beings
come into the world with certain fixed tendencies to act. These
original impulses may be obscured, but cannot be abolished. Secondly,
reflection upon morals always must occur in a given social situation,
that is, in a situation where certain habits of mind, emotion and
action, are already in operation. Moral standards are not fresh
constructions; they are <i>reconstructions</i>. We may want to
<i>change</i> current customs and traditions; but that is simply
another way of iterating the fact that they <i>are there to be
changed</i>. The moral reformer who would improve society must
take into account the fact that there exist among the adult members
of a generation, powerful habits, which may be improved or amended,
but which cannot be ignored. Any attempt to improve men's ways of
action starts within <a name="page_429"><span class="page">Page
429</span></a> processes of action already going on. It is not as
if we could hold up the processes of human life, and say, "Let
us begin afresh." The generation whose habits are to be changed
consists of living men, who are acting on the basis of customs which
have become intimately and powerfully controlling in their lives.
These customs, though they may not be altogether satisfactory, are
yet great social economies. They give men certain determinate and
efficacious modes of action. Reflection must start with them and from
them. Unless men, furthermore, did act according to custom, they
would have to reflect in detail about every step of their conduct.
The aim of reflection is simply to transform existing customs into
more effective methods for achieving the good.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reflection, indeed, must move within certain limits; it must take
certain things for granted. We have already seen that reflection
arises in a crisis of greater or lesser degree; it settles ambiguities,
resolves the obscure and doubtful phases of situations. It is designed
to secure adjustments where instinct and habit are inadequate to
adapt the individual to his environment. But unless there were
certain fixed, determined points to start with, certain limits
within which reflection could operate, and which it could use as
points of reference or departure, all would be chaos, and reflection
would be impossible. It is precisely because we do take certain things
as settled, because, as the phrase runs, "they go without saying,"
that we can think to any purpose whatsoever. Useful customs once
established provide precisely these fixed points. If arbitration
of labor disputes has become a fixed social habit, for example,
attention can be turned to ways and means. If education has become a
generally approved social habit, we can spend our time on instruments
and methods. Every useful custom firmly established gives a basis
of operations. That much is settled; that much does not demand our
alert attention and inquiry. A society without any fixed habits
would be sheer anarchy. The aim of intelligent consideration of
morals is not to abolish customs, but to bring about their <a
name="page_430"><span class="page">Page 430</span></a> modification
so that they will be the most effective adjustment of the individual
and the group to their environment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Indeed, in advanced societies, reflection may itself become a custom,
and the most highly valued of all. For where alert and conscious
criticism of existing folkways is habitual among all the members
of a society, that society is saved from subjection through inertia
to disserviceable habits. It acts as a continual check and control;
it prevents social and moral stagnation. The habit of reflection
upon conduct, if it could be made generally current, would insure
social progress. For customs would be regarded merely as tools,
as instruments to be modified and adapted to new circumstances,
as provisional modes of attaining the good. Fixity and rigidity
in social life would give place to flexibility and wise continual
adaptation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The values of reflective morality.</b> Some of these have already
been noted. We may briefly summarize the foregoing discussion, and
call attention to some additional values of a morality based upon
reason, as contrasted with a morality of mere mechanical conformity to
custom. It has already been pointed out that intellectual preferences
and valuations are rooted in primary impulses; that is, our desires
are anterior to reflection. What we intellectually value and prefer
has its roots in primary impulses. Reason can discover how man
may attain the good; but what <i>is</i> good is determined by the
desires with which man is, willy-nilly, endowed. Our preferences
are, within limits, fixed for us. As Santayana writes:
</p>

<p class="include">
Reason was born, as it has since discovered, into a world already
wonderfully organized, in which it found its precursor in what is
called life, its seat in an animal body of unusual plasticity,
and its function in rendering that body's volatile instincts and
sensations harmonious with one another and with the outer world
on which they depend.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>Life of Reason</i>, vol. I, p. 40.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our chief aim in reflective behavior is to discover ways and means by
which a harmony may be achieved, a harmony of <a name="page_431"><span
class="page">Page 431</span></a> those very instincts which, left
to themselves, would be in perpetual collision, frustrating and
checking each other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reflection not only seeks to find a way of life in which no natural
impulse shall be frustrated, but it is through reflection that desires
are broadened, and that new desires arise. Out of reflection upon
social relations, which is in the first instance prompted by man's
innate gregariousness, arise the conception of ideal friendship and
the thirst for and movement toward ideal society. Out of reflection
upon the animal passion of sex may rise Dante's beatific vision of
Beatrice. Conduct, consciously controlled, finds not only ways
by which animal desires may be fulfilled without catastrophe; it
transmutes animal desires into ideal values.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflection transforms customs into principles.</b> In reflective
behavior, as contrasted with that which is controlled by instinct
and custom, there are established standards of action to which
the individual consciously conforms. That is, instead of merely
conforming to custom, an individual comes to act upon principles,
consciously avowed and maintained. A man who sets up a standard of
action in his professional or business relations is not conforming
to an arbitrary code; he is living according to a way of life which
he has deliberately and consciously chosen. When a man acts upon
principles because he has consciously adopted them in view of the
consequences which he believes to be associated with them, he will
not make his standard an idol. Reflection establishes standards, but
it is not mastered by them. It is persistently critical. Standards
are tools, instruments toward the achievement of the good. They
are merely general rules, derived from experience and retained
so long as they bear desirable fruits in experience. Moral laws
are not regarded as arbitrary and eternal, but as good only in
so far as they produce good. A virtue is a virtue because it is
conducive to human well-being. Standards are not absolute, but
relative&mdash;relative to their fruits in practice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflective action genuinely moral.</b> Action is most genuinely
<a name="page_432"><span class="page">Page 432</span></a> moral
when it is reflective. It is only then that the individual is a
conscious and controlling agent. It is only then that he knows
what he is doing. When a machine performs actions that happen to
have useful results, we do not speak of the action as moral or
virtuous. And action in conformity with custom is purely mechanical
and arbitrary. An individual who is merely conforming to the customary
is no more moral than an automaton. Given a certain situation, he makes
a certain response. It makes no difference that the act happens to
have fruitful consequences. It is not a matter of individual choice,
of conscious volition. Aristotle long ago stated the indispensable
conditions of moral actions:
</p>

<p class="include">
It is necessary that the agent at the time of performing them should
satisfy certain conditions, <i>i.e.</i> in the first place that he
should know what he is doing, secondly that he should deliberately
choose to do it and to do it for its own sake, and thirdly that he
should do it as an instance of a fixed and immutable moral state.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Aristotle: <i>Ethics</i>, book II, p. 42 (Weldon
translation).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Only when the individual is aware of the consequences of his action,
and deliberately chooses those consequences, is there any individuality,
any exhibition of choice&mdash;in other words, any moral value
in the act. When an act is prompted by mere habit and custom, we
have an evidence of an individual's environment rather than of
his character. Creatures thus moved by capricious and arbitrary
impulse are hardly persons, and certainly not personalities. They
are played upon by every whimsicality of circumstance; their own
character makes no difference at all in the world in which they
live. To act reflectively is to be the controlling rather than the
controlled element in a situation. Action guided by intelligence
is freed from the enslavement of passion, prejudice, and routine. It
becomes genuinely free. The individual, emancipated from emotion,
sense, and circumstance, from the accidental environment in which
he happens to be born, is in command of his conduct. "Though shakes
the magnet, steady is <a name="page_433"><span class="page">Page
433</span></a> the pole." Morally, at least, he is "the master
of his fate, the captain of his soul."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Reflection sets up ideal standards.</b> Reflection constantly
sets up ideal standards by which current codes of conduct are judged
and corrected. It is clear that ideals of life, even when sincerely
entertained, are not always possible of immediate fulfillment.
Theory tends continually to outrun practice, since human reflection
tends to set up goals in advance of its achievement. For many
individuals, anxious to attain immediate self-enhancement, the
current cones are not criticized at all, but are taken for granted,
as inevitable and irrefragable bases of operation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many men, perhaps after a first flush of altruistic rebellion in
adolescence, settle down with more or less complacency to the current
moral codes. They do in Rome as the Romans do. They may have an
intellectual awareness of the crassness, the stupidity, the essential
injustice and inadequacy of the codes by which men in contemporary
society live, but they may also, out of selfish preoccupation with
their own interests, let things go at that. If the established
ways are not as they ought to be, at least they are as they are.
And since the current system is the one by which a man must live,
assent is the better part of wisdom. There are comparatively few
who persist in a criticism of prevailing standards, or who are
troubled very much beyond their early twenties by a tormenting
conviction that things are not done as they ought to be done. It
is from the few who realize intellectually the inadequacies of
prevailing customs, and are emotionally disturbed by them, that
moral criticism arises. And it is only by such criticism that moral
progress is made possible. "The duty of some exercise of discriminating
intelligence as to existing customs, for the sake of improvement
and progress, is thus a mark of reflective morality&mdash;of the
r&eacute;gime of conscience as over against custom."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey and Tufts: <i>Ethics</i>, pp. 181-82.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Reflection is thus the process by which progress is made <a
name="page_434"><span class="page">Page 434</span></a> possible,
although, as we shall presently see, it is not thereby insured.
The function of intelligence is precisely to indicate anticipated
goods, "to imagine a future which is the projection of the desirable
in the present." Even the best ordered life or society reveals some
maladjustment, some remove, near or far, from perfection. It is
the business of reflection and imagination to note the discrepancy
between what is, and what ought to be, and assiduously to foster
the vision of the latter, so that in the light of that imagined
good, men's ways of life may be amended.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nor does the setting-up of ideal standards mean the construction
of fruitless Utopias. Reflection upon the present ways of life
and the prospect of their improvement does not mean a mere wistful
yearning after better things. It means careful inquiry into those
elements of established ways which may be incorporated into the
construction of the ideal. It means the resolute application of
intelligence to an analysis of present maladjustments in the interests
of preserving out of inherited and current ways those factors which
point towards the goal desired. It means to be eager for perfection,
and sensitive to current imperfections. Moral progress demands a
vision of the desirable future, and a persistent and discriminating
reflection upon the means of its attainment out of the materials
of the present.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The defects of reflective morality.</b> Reflection, as already
pointed out, tends to stop with merely destructive criticism. Provoked
by maladjustment and imperfection, it frequently goes no further than
to note these, with cynicism or despair. Criticism of established
customs and ways of life frequently rests with the exhibition of
absurdities in men's ways, finding refuge in laughter or rebellion.
There is no one so cynical as the man who has been recently wakened
out of dogmatic and innocent faith in the traditions to which he
has been reared.
</p>

<p class="include">
The child receives from the herd the doctrines, let us say, that
truthfulness is the most valuable of all the virtues, that honesty
is the best policy, that to the religious man death has no terrors,
and <a name="page_435"><span class="page">Page 435</span></a> that
there is in store a future life of perfect happiness and delight.
And yet experience tells him with persistence that truthfulness as
often as not brings him punishment, that his dishonest playfellow
has as good if not a better time than he, that the religious man
shrinks from death with as great a terror as the unbeliever, is
as broken-hearted by bereavement, and as determined to continue
his hold upon this imperfect life rather than trust himself to
what he declares to be the certainty of future bliss.... Who of us
is there who cannot remember the vague feeling of dissatisfaction,
the obscure and elusive sense of something being wrong, which is
left by these and similar conflicts?[1]

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
A little reflection is, in morals, a dangerous thing. It discovers
difficulties, and does not solve them. It finds that human life is
darkly strewn with hypocrisies, with shams, with makeshifts and
compromises. And having made this discovery, it sighs or satirizes
or forgets. It is notorious with what frequency men "go to pieces"
when they are loosed from the moorings of their childhood moralities,
before they have had a chance to acquire new and more reasonable
constraints. Plato, in protesting that young men should not study
philosophy too early, has well described the dangers of shallow
analysis.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: "And will it not be one great precaution to forbid
their meddling with it [philosophy] while young? For I suppose
you have noticed, that whenever boys taste dialectic for the first
time, they pervert it into an amusement, and always employ it for
purposes of contradiction, and imitate in their own persons the
artifices of those who study refutation,&mdash;delighting, like
puppies, in pulling and tearing to pieces with logic any one who
comes near them.... Hence, when they have experienced many triumphs
and many defeats, they fall, quickly and vehemently, into an utter
disbelief of their former sentiments: and thereby both they and
the whole cause of philosophy have been prejudiced in the eyes
of the world." (Plato: <i>Republic</i>, Golden Treasury edition,
p. 267.)]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The inadequacy of theory in moral life.</b> Reflection upon
morals, even when it goes beyond the stage of criticism and proceeds
to the reconstruction of habits and customs upon a more reasonable
basis, is yet inadequate. However logically convincing a code of
morals may be, it is not efficacious simply as logic. In Aristotle's
still relevant words:
</p>

<p class="include">
It may fairly be said then that a just man becomes just by doing
<a name="page_436"><span class="page">Page 436</span></a> what
is just and a temperate man becomes temperate by doing what is
temperate, and if a man did not so act, he would not have so much
as a chance of becoming good. But most people, instead of doing
such actions, take refuge in theorizing; they imagine that they are
philosophers and that philosophy will make them virtuous; in fact
they behave like people who listen attentively to their doctors,
but never do anything that their doctors tell them. But it is as
improbable that a healthy state of the soul will be produced by
this kind of philosophizing as that a healthy state of the body
will be produced by this kind of medical treatment.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Aristotle: <i>Ethics</i>, book II, chap. III, pp. 42-43
(Weldon translation).]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Moral standards, in order to be effective, must have emotional
support and be constantly applied. Men must be in love with the
good, if good is to be their habitual practice. And only when the
good is an habitual practice, can men be said to be living a moral
life instead of merely subscribing verbally to a set of moral ideals.
Justice, honesty, charity, mercy, benevolence, these are names
for types of behavior, and are real in so far as they do describe
men's actions. As Aristotle says, in another connection: "A person
must be utterly senseless if he does not know that moral states
are formed by the exercise of the powers in one way or another."
The virtues are not static or frozen; they are names we give to
varieties of action, and are exhibited, as they exist, <i>only</i>
in action.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: "But the virtues we acquire by first exercising them,
as is the case with all the arts, for it is by doing what we ought to
do when we have learned the arts, that we learn the arts themselves;
we become, <i>e.g.</i> builders by building, and harpists by playing
the harp. Similarly it is by doing just acts that we become just, by
doing temperate acts that we become temperate, by doing courageous
acts that we become courageous.... Again the causes and means by
which any virtue is produced, and by which it is destroyed, are
the same; and it is equally so with any art; for it is by playing
the harp that both good and bad harpists are produced, and the
case of builders and all other artisans is similar, as it is by
building well that they will be good builders, and by building
badly that they will be bad builders.... It is by acting in such
transactions as take place between man and man that we become either
just or unjust. It is by acting in the face of danger and habituating
ourselves to fear or courage that we become either cowardly or
courageous. It is much the same with our desires and angry passions.
Some people become temperate and gentle, others become licentious
and passionate, according as they conduct themselves in one way or
another way in particular circumstances." (Aristotle: <i>Ethics</i>,
pp. 35-36, Weldon translation.)]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_437"><span class="page">Page 437</span></a> The mere
preaching of virtue will thus not produce its practice. Those standards
which reflection discovers, however useful in the guidance of life,
are not sufficient to improve human conduct. They must, as noted
above, be emotionally sanctioned to become habitual, and, on the
other hand, only if they are early acquired habits, will the emotions
associated with them be pleasant rather than painful. "Accordingly
the difference between one training of habits and another from
early days is not a light matter, but is serious or rather
all-important."[1] Ideals of life, when they remain mere closet-ideals,
are interesting academic specimens, but are hardly effective in the
helpful amendment of the lives of mankind. "Whoever contemplates the
world in the light of an ideal," writes Bertrand Russell, "whether
what he seeks be intellect or art, or love, or simple happiness,
or all together, must feel a great sorrow in the evils which men
allow needlessly to continue and&mdash;if he is a man of force and
vital energy&mdash;an urgent desire to lead men to the realization
of the good which inspires his creative vision." Great thinkers
upon morals have not been content to work out interesting systems
which were logically conclusive, abstract methods of attaining
happiness. They have worked out their ethical systems as genuinely
preferred ways of life, they have offered them as solutions of
the difficulties men experience in controlling their own passions
and in adapting their desires to the conditions which limit their
fulfillment.

"Our present study," writes Aristotle, "is not, like other studies,
purely speculative in its intention; for the object of our inquiry is
not to know the nature of virtue, but to become ourselves virtuous,
as that is the sole benefit which it conveys."[2] Reflection upon
morals can map out the road; it cannot make people travel it. For
that, an early habituation to the good is necessary.

<p class="indent">
<b>The danger of intellectualism in morals.</b> There has been
throughout the history of ethical theory a tendency to oversimplify
life by cramping it into the categories fixed by reason. Reflection
tends to set up certain standards which the infinite variety of
human experience tends to outrun. In the mere fact of setting up
generalizations, reflection is arbitrary. Any generalization, by
virtue of the very fact that it does apply to a wide variety of
situations, must forego concern with the peculiar colors and qualities
inhering in any specific experience. Various ethical writers have
set up general rules, which they have attempted to apply to life
with indiscriminate ruthlessness. They have tried to shear down
the endless rich variety of human situations to fit the categories
which they assume to start with. Unsophisticated men have complained
with justice against the recurrent attempts of moralists to set
up absolute laws, standards, virtues, which were to be applied
regardless of the specific circumstances of specific situations.
It was such formalism that Aristotle protested against throughout
his <i>Ethics</i>.
</p>

<p class="include">
There is the same sort of uncertainty with regard to good things,
as it often happens that injuries result from them; thus there
have been cases in which people were ruined by wealth, or again by
courage. As our subjects [moral inquiries] then and our premises
are of this nature, we must be content to indicate the truth roughly,
and in outline.[1]

in reasoning upon particular ethical cases. They do not fall under
any art or any law, but the agents themselves are always bound
to pay regard to the circumstances of the moment, as much as in
medicine or navigation.[1]

towards the right persons, and for the right causes and in the right

of virtue.[2]

<p class="indent">
Reflection thus unduly simplifies the moral problem by setting up
general standards which are not adequate to the multiple variety
of specific situations which constitute human experience. But in
reasoning upon the conduct of life, there has been displayed,
furthermore, by ethical writers an inveterate tendency to identify
the processes of life with the process of reason. One may cite as
a classic instance of this point of view the ethical theory of
Jeremy Bentham and the Utilitarians. According to the Utilitarians
human beings judged acts in terms of their utility, as measured in
the amount of pleasure and pain produced by an action. The individual
figured out the pleasures and pains that would be the consequences
of his action. We shall in the next section examine this point
of view in more detail; we are referring to it here simply as an
illustration of intellectualizing of morals. Few individuals go
through anything remotely resembling the "hedonic calculus" laid
down by Bentham.[3] The individual <a name="page_440"><span
class="page">Page 440</span></a> is not a static being, mathematically
considering the amount of pleasure and pain associated with the
performance of specific actions. We are, in the vast majority of
cases, prompted to specific responses, not by any mathematical
considerations of pleasures and pains, but by the immediate urgency
of instinctive and habitual desires. Reflection arises in the process
of adjustment of competing impulses, in the effecting of a harmony
between various desires that are much more primary and fundamental
than the reflection that arises upon them. We may largely agree
with McDougall when he writes:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 3: The hedonic calculus of Bentham was, briefly, the
following: "Every proposed act is to be viewed with reference to
its probable consequences, in (1) intensity of pleasures and pains,
(2) their duration, (3) their certainty or uncertainty, (4) their
nearness or remoteness, (5) their fecundity, <i>i.e.</i>, the tendency
of a pleasure to be followed by others, or a pain by other pains;
(6) their purity, <i>i.e.</i>, the tendency of a pleasure to be
followed by pains and <i>vice versa</i>; (7) their extent, that is,
the number or range of persons whose happiness is affected&mdash;with
reference to whose pleasures and pains each one of the first six
items ought in strictness also to be calculated. Then sum up all
the pleasures which stand to the credit side of the account; add
the pains which are the debit items, or liabilities, on the other;
then take their algebraic sum, and the balance of it on the side of
pleasure will be the good tendency of the act upon the whole."
(Dewey and Tufts: <i>Ethics</i>, pp. 275-76.)
</p>

<p class="include">
We may say, then, that directly or indirectly, the instincts are
the prime movers of all human activity; by the conative or impulsive
force of some instinct (or of some habit derived from an instinct)
every train of thought, however cold and passionless it may seem, is
borne along towards its end, and every bodily activity is initiated
and sustained. The instinctive impulses determine the ends of all
activities and supply the driving power by which all mental activities
are sustained; and all the complex intellectual apparatus of the
most highly developed mind is but a means towards these ends, is
but the instrument by which these impulses seek their satisfactions,
while pleasure and pain do but serve to guide them in their choice
of the means.
</p>

<p class="include">
Take away these instinctive dispositions with their powerful impulses,
and the organism would become incapable of activity of any kind; it
would lie inert and motionless, like a wonderful clockwork whose
mainspring had been removed, or a steam-engine whose fires had
been drawn.[1]

<p class="footnote">

Reflection is last rather than first; it is provoked and sustained by
instinctive desires, and is the means whereby they may be fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_441"><span class="page">Page 441</span></a> <b>Types
of moral theory.</b> Reflection upon morals produces certain
characteristic types of moral theory. These may be classified,
although, because of the complexity of factors involved in any
moral theory, cross-division is inevitable. But in the long history
of human reflection upon a reasonable way of life, certain divisions
stand out clearly. The first great contrast that may be mentioned
is that existing between Absolutism and Relativism, the contrast,
namely, between theories of morals that regard right and wrong as
absolute and <i>a priori</i>, unconditioned by time, place, and
circumstance; and theories of morals that judge the rightness and
wrongness of acts in terms of their consequences, in the happiness
or welfare of human beings, however that be conceived. These two
points of view represent radically different temperaments and differ
radically in their fruits. The contrast will stand out more clearly
after a brief discussion of each.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Absolutism.</b> Absolutistic moralities are distinguished by their
maintenance of the fundamental moral idea of Duty, Duty consisting in
an obligation to conform to the Right. Implied in this obligation of
absolute conformity is the conception that the Right is unalterable,
universally binding, and imperative. Good and evil are not discoverable
in experience, but are standards to which human beings must in
experience conform. The right is not simply the
desirable&mdash;frequently it is, from the standpoint of impulses and
emotion, the undesirable; but it is a universal, an <i>a priori</i>
standard to which human beings must in experience conform. Morals
are "eternal and immutable" principles, absolutely irrefutable and
indefeasible in experience. We shall, in approaching the problem
from the standpoint of moral knowledge, see that most absolutist
moral philosophers have also supposed that these eternal principles
of right action are intuitively perceived. What concerns us in this
connection, however, is the nature of this absolutistic conception,
and its bearings on the governance of human conduct.
</p>

<p class="indent">
According to the absolutist, the "goodness" of an act is <a
name="page_442"><span class="page">Page 442</span></a> not at all
affected by its immediate consequences. The value of a good or a
moral act does not consist in its results. The moral value of an
act consists in the "good-will" of the agent, and the "good-will"
of the agent consists in his willing and conscious conformity to
the absolute moral principle involved. "Nothing is fundamentally
good but the good-will." That is, an act to be moral, must be the
conscious conformity of a rational agent to the moral law, which
he recognizes to be morally binding. To Kant, the classic exponent
of this position, an act performed out of mere inclination, if not
immoral, certainly was not moral. A moral act could only flow from
reason, and reason would dictate to an individual conformity to
the moral law, which was a law of reason. Conduct that is determined
by mere circumstance is not moral conduct. Morality is above the
domain of circumstance. And the moral agent is above the defeats
and compromises imposed by time and place. He is a free agent, that
is, morally free. He accepts no commands, except those of reason.
A man, in following impulse or being dictated to by circumstance,
is a mere animal or a machine. He is only a reasonable, that is,
a moral being, when he conforms to the laws which are above time
and place and circumstance, and above the whirls and eddies of
personal inclination.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Concretely, one may take the absolutistic attitude toward a specific
virtue: honesty. The morality of telling the truth consists in a
conscious conformity to the moral standard of honesty in the face
of all deflections of inclination and particular situations. It
makes no iota of difference what the result of telling the truth
in a particular instance may be. It makes no difference what urgent
and plausible and practically decent reason one has for not telling
the truth. The truth must be told, as justice must be done, though
the heavens fall. We have a case, let us suppose, where telling bad
news to a very sick man may kill him. That temporally disastrous
consequence is, from an absolutistic point of view, a totally irrelevant
consideration, as is also the pain we feel <a name="page_443"><span
class="page">Page 443</span></a> in telling the truth under such
conditions. But the single moral course is clear; there is no
alternative; in absolutistic morals there are no extenuating
circumstances. The truth must be told, whatever be the consequences.
For to tell the truth is a universal moral law, and conformity to
that law a universal moral obligation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The defects of this position, if they are not obvious from its bare
statement, will become clearer from the analysis of the relativist or
teleological positions. But its specific virtues deserve attention.
The Kantian or absolutistic position, by its emphasis on the
indefeasible and unwavering character of moral action, suggests
something that rouses admiration from common sense, unsophisticated
by moral theory. We do not think highly of the man who is at the mercy
of every chance appetite, or every casual incident. Morality must
be constituted of more enduring stuff. We do not deeply admire the
caliber of a man who yields to every pressing exigency, surrendering
thereby every ideal, principle, or value, the attainment of which
demands some postponement or some privation of the fulfillment of
immediate desire. The man who compromises his political ideals
in the attainment of his personal success, is a scornful figure
morally. And we estimate more highly the character of an individual
who can persist in the strenuous attainment of an ideal in the face
of the counter-inclination of passing pleasures. In its emphasis
on the autonomy and integrity of moral action, even its opponents
credit the Kantian or absolutistic position with having hit upon
a genuinely moral aspect of human action. It is, as we shall see,
in the rigidity and formalism of its conception, in its fanatical
allegiance to <i>a priori</i> standards, and its absolute sanctification
of given ways of action, that the theory is questionable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Relativistic or teleological morality.</b> Contrasted with the
theories of morals that maintain that right and wrong are absolute
and eternal principles unaffected by time, place, and circumstance,
are those moral philosophies which set out <a name="page_444"><span
class="page">Page 444</span></a> explicitly to discover a way of
life by which human happiness in this world of time and place and
circumstance may be attained. To know what is the supreme good, and
to discover what are the means of its attainment, are, as Aristotle
long ago and justly observed, of great importance in the regulation of
life. It is this knowledge and discovery that constitute, according
to Aristotle, the business of ethics. Regarding this "supreme good,"
we may quote his own expressions:
</p>

<p class="include">
We speak of that which is sought after for its own sake, as more
final than that which is sought after as a means to something else;
we speak of that which is never desired as a means to something else
as more final than the things which are desired both in themselves
and as means to something else; and we speak of a thing as absolutely
final, if it is always desired in itself and never as a means to
something else.
</p>

<p class="include">
It seems that happiness pre&euml;minently answers to this description,
as we always desire happiness for its own sake, and never as a means
to something else, whereas we desire honour, pleasure, intellect,
and every virtue, partly for their own sakes,... but partly also
as being means to happiness, because we suppose they will prove
the instruments of happiness. Happiness, on the other hand, nobody
desires for the sake of these things, nor indeed as a means to
anything else at all.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Aristotle: <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 13-14.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Happiness may, as Aristotle observes, be differently conceived by
different people. To some it may mean a life of sensual enjoyment;
to some men a life of money-making. But it is the attainment of
<i>complete</i> satisfaction and self-realization by the individual
that ethical theories should promote; for such self-realization
constitutes happiness. It is sufficient here to point out that
all so-called "teleological" or "relativistic" moralities, insist
that the morality of an action is not determinable <i>a priori</i>,
or absolutely. They are <i>relativistic</i> in the sense that they
insist on taking into account the specific circumstances of action
in the determination of its moral value. They are <i>teleological</i>
in that they insist on measuring the moral value of an action in
terms of its consequences <a name="page_445"><span class="page">Page
445</span></a> in human well-being or happiness, however those
be conceived. To revert to the illustration used in connection
with the discussion of Absolutism, to lie in order to save a life
would, on this basis, be construed as good rather than evil.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Utilitarianism.</b> One of the classic statements of relativistic
and teleological morality is Utilitarianism. According to the
Utilitarians the criterion of the worth of a deed was to be found
in an estimation of the relative pleasures and pains produced by
it. The view is thus stated by John Stuart Mill:
</p>

<p class="include">
The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or
the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right
in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they
tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended
pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the
privation of pleasure. To give a clear view of the moral standard
set up by the theory, much more requires to be said; in particular,
what things it includes in the ideas of pain and pleasure; and to
what extent this is left an open question. But these supplementary
explanations do not affect the theory of life on which this theory
of morality is grounded&mdash;namely, that pleasure and freedom from
pain are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable
things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any other
scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves,
or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of
pain.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Mill: <i>Utilitarianism</i> (London, 1907), pp. 9-10.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Simply stated, Utilitarianism says: "Add together all the pleasures
promised by a contemplated course of action, then the pains, and
note the difference; the nature of the difference will determine
whether the course is right or wrong." Pleasures and pains are thus
conceived as being open to quantitative determination. Action is
determined by mathematical calculation in advance of the pleasure
and pain produced by any action. Bentham's name is particularly
associated with the dictum, "the greatest happiness for the greatest
number." But two implications of this doctrine must be taken into
account, at least as Bentham interpreted it. The greatest happiness
meant the maximum amount of pleasure. And <a name="page_446"><span
class="page">Page 446</span></a> each individual could desire the
greatest happiness, only in so far as it contributed to his own
happiness or pleasure. And, for Bentham, as for all strict Utilitarians,
there was no qualitative distinction in the amounts of pleasure.
"The quantity being the same," said Bentham, "pushpin is as good
as poetry."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Utilitarianism is here considered as an instance of a type of ethical
theory that set human happiness as the end, and made its judgments
of actions depend on their consequences in human welfare. It must be
pointed out, however, that its conception of happiness was dependent
on a psychology now almost unanimously recognized as false: Bentham's
assumption that the <i>reason</i> human beings performed certain
actions was <i>because</i> they desired certain pleasures, completely
reverses the actual situation. It puts, as it were, the cart before
the horse. Pleasure is psychologically the accompaniment, what
psychologists call the "feeling tone" of the satisfaction of any
instinctive or habitual impulse. Human beings have certain native or
habitual tendencies to action, and pleasure attends the performance
of these. It is not because we want the pleasure of eating, that we
decide to eat; we want to eat, and eating is therefore pleasant.
</p>

<p class="include">
If the good Samaritan cared about the present feelings or the future
welfare of the man fallen among thieves, it would no doubt give
him some pleasure to satisfy that desire for his welfare; if he
had desired his good as little as the priest and the Levite, there
would have been nothing to suggest the strange idea that to relieve
him, to bind up his nasty wounds, and to spend money upon him,
would be a source of more pleasure to himself than to pass by on
the other side and spend the money upon himself. In the case of
the great majority of our pleasures, it will probably be found
that the desire is the condition of the pleasure, not the pleasure
of the desire.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Rashdall: <i>Ethics</i>, p. 18.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
As has been previously pointed out in this and other chapters, action
does not start with reflection upon pleasures, or, for that matter,
upon anything else. Action is fundamentally <a name="page_447"><span
class="page">Page 447</span></a> initiated by instinctive promptings,
or the promptings of habit. Satisfaction or pleasure attends the
fulfillment of any inborn or acquired impulse, and dissatisfaction
or pain its obstruction or frustration. Apart from the satisfactions
experienced in the fulfillment in action of such impulses, pleasure
does not exist. Actions, situations, persons, or ideas can be pleasant
to us, but "pleasure" as a separate objective entity cannot be said
to exist at all. The Utilitarians, again, made the intellectualist
error of supposing that men dispassionately and mathematically
weighed the consequences of their actions, whereas their relative
impulsions to action are determined by the instincts they inherit
and the habits they have already acquired.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Despite its false psychology, Utilitarianism does stand out as one
of the great classic attempts to build an ethical theory squarely
designed to promote human happiness. An execution of the same worthy
intention, more acceptable to those trained in the modern psychology
of instinct, is that moral conception variously known as Behaviorism,
or Energism, a point of view maintained by thinkers from Aristotle
to Professor Dewey in our own day. All behavioristic theories take
the position that in order to find out what is good for man, we must
begin by finding out what man is. In order to discover what will
give man satisfaction, we must discover what his natural impulses
and capacities are. In the utilization and fulfillment of these
will man find his most complete realization and happiness. The
standard of goodness, therefore, is measured in terms of the extent
to which action promotes a complete and harmonious utilization
of natural impulses and natural capacities. Ethics, from such a
viewpoint, cannot set up arbitrary standards, but must form its
standards by inquiries into the fundamental and natural needs and
desires of men. Instead of laying down eternal principles to which
human beings must be made to conform, it must derive its principles
from observations of human experience, and test them there. The
good is what does good; the bad what does <a name="page_448"><span
class="page">Page 448</span></a> harm. And what is good for men,
and bad for men, depends not on rigid <i>a priori</i> intellectual
standards, but on the original nature which is each man's inheritance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To base ethics upon an analysis of the conditions of human nature,
as scientific inquiry reveals it, carries with it two implications.
It means that nothing that is shown to be a part of man's inevitable
original equipment can with justice to man's welfare be ruled out.
Every instinct taken by itself is as good as any other. It is only
when one instinct competes with another, so that excessive indulgence
of one, as, for example, that of sex or pugnacity, interferes with
all a man's other instincts or interests (or with those of other
men), that an instinct becomes evil. It means, secondly, that since
individuals differ, and since situations are infinitely various
and individual, no arbitrary and fixed laws can be laid down as
fundamental eternal principles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Moral knowledge.</b> The contrast between the two types of morality
that have been historically current may be approached from the
standpoint of moral knowledge. That is, moral theories may be classified
on the basis of their answer to the question: How do moral judgments
arise? The chief contrast to be drawn is that between Intuitionalism
on the one hand, and Empiricism on the other. Intuitionalism holds
briefly that the moral quality of an act is intuitively perceived,
and is recognized apart from experience of its consequences. The
empirical theory holds that moral judgments come to be attached
to acts as a result of experience, and particularly experiences
of the approval and disapproval of other people. The contrast will
again become clearer by a discussion of each theory separately.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Intuitionalism.</b> Intuitionalism takes two chief forms. The
first, Perceptual Intuitionalism, as Sidgwick calls it, holds that
the rightness of each particular act is immediately known. The
second, called by the same author Dogmatic Intuitionalism, holds
that the general laws of common-sense morality are immediately
perceived. The popular view of "conscience," <a name="page_449"><span
class="page">Page 449</span></a> well illustrates the first-mentioned
position of the Intuitionalist.
</p>

<p class="include">
We commonly think of the dictates of conscience as relating to
particular actions, and when a man is bidden in a particular case
to "trust to his conscience," it commonly seems to be meant that
he should exercise a faculty of judging morally this particular
case without reference to general rules, and even in opposition to
conclusions obtained by systematic deduction from such rules.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Sidgwick: <i>Methods of Ethics</i> (4th edition), p.
99.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Conscience, this organ of immediate moral perception, is frequently
taken to be divinely given at birth. There is no one so certain or
immovable as the man whose actions are dictated by his "conscience."
He does not have to think about his actions; he knows immediately
what is right and what is wrong. The intuitionalist does not go
into the natural history of scruples for or against the performance
of certain actions. He takes these immediate aversions or promptings
to act as the revelations of immediate and unquestionable knowledge,
frequently presumed to be divinely implanted. Most Intuitionalists
hold not that we experience an immediate intuition of the rightness
or wrongness of action in every single situation, but that the common
rules of morality, such common rules as good faith and veracity,
are immediately recognized and assented to as moral. They insist
that these are not determined by experience or by reflection, since
stealing, lying, and murder are <i>known</i> to be wrong by everyone,
though most men could not tell way.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Intuitionalism carried out to logical extremes is represented by
such men as Tclstoy, and, in general, those who genuinely and
persistently act according to the dictates of their conscience,
"who hold, and so far as they can, act upon the principle that
we must never resist force by force, never arrest a thief, must
literally give to him that asketh, up to one's last penny, and
so on."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Empiricism.</b> To explain the grounds of the Empirical position
is to exhibit the arguments in refutation of Intuitionalism. <a
name="page_450"><span class="page">Page 450</span></a> The most
obvious and frequent line of attack that empirical moralists make
upon Intuitionalism is to examine and compare the various "intuitions"
of right conduct which have been held by men in different ages and
places.
</p>

<p class="include">
The traditional method of combating intuitionalism from the time
of John Locke to that of Herbert Spencer has been to present the
reader with a list of cruel and abominable savage customs, ridiculous
superstitions, acts of religious fanaticism and intolerance, which
have all alike seemed self-evidently good and right to the peoples
or individuals who have practised them. There is hardly a vice
or a crime (according to our own moral standard) which has not
at some time or other in some circumstances been looked upon as
a moral and religious duty. Stealing was accounted virtuous for
the young Spartan, and among the Indian caste of Thugs. In the
ancient world, piracy, that is, robbery and murder, was a respectable
profession. To the medi&aelig;val Christian, religious persecution
was the highest of duties, and so on.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Rashdall: <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 59.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Empiricist asks: If all these intuitions are absolute; if men
at various times and at various places, indeed, if, as is the case,
men of different social classes and situations at the present time,
differ so profoundly in their "intuitions" of the just, the noble,
and the base, which of the conflicting intuitions, all equally
absolute, is <i>the</i> absolute? The Intuitionalist continually
appeals to the universal intuition and assent of Mankind. But there
is scarcely a single moral law for which universal assent in even
a single generation can be found. One has but to survey the
heterogeneous collection of customs and prohibitions collected
in such a work as Frazer's <i>Golden Bough</i>, to see how little
unanimity there is in the moral intuitions of mankind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Empiricist finds the origin of these divergent moral convictions
in the divergent environments to which individuals in different
places, times, and social situations are exposed. The intensity
and apparent irrefutability of these convictions, which the
Intuitionalist ascribes to their innateness, <a name="page_451"><span
class="page">Page 451</span></a> the Empiricist ascribes to their
early acquisition, and the deep emotional hold which early acquired
habits have over the individual. Those moral beliefs which we hold
with the utmost conviction and intensity are, instead of being
thereby guaranteed as most reasonable and genuinely moral, thereby
rendered, says the Empiricist, the more suspect. They are evidences
of the effectiveness of our early education, or of our high degree
of sensitiveness to our fellows. Conscience is thus reduced to
habitual emotional reactions produced by the contact of a given
individual temperament with a given environment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus acts come by the individual to be recognized as right or wrong,
according to the tradition to which he has been educated and the
contacts with other people to which he is continually exposed. The
Empiricist does not deny that there are intuitions, or apparent
intuitions. He denies their ultimacy, their unquestionable validity.
</p>

<p class="include">
When ... we find ourselves entertaining an opinion about the basis
of which there is a quality of feeling which tells us that to inquire
into it would be absurd, obviously unnecessary, unprofitable,
undesirable, bad form, or wicked, we may know that that opinion is
a non-rational one, and probably, therefore, founded upon inadequate
evidence.[1]

These so powerful convictions are the immediate promptings of instincts,
or of the habits into which they have been modified. The humane
Christian, had he been brought up in the Eskimo tradition, would
with the most tender solicitude slaughter his aged parents, just
as the humane Christian in the Middle Ages thought it his duty
to slay heretics. There is no limit to the excesses to which men
have gone on the dictates of conscience. To put actions on the
basis of conscience is to put them beyond the control of reflection
or the check of inquiry. It is to reduce conduct to caprice; to
exalt impulse into a moral command. And the results of accepting
<a name="page_452"><span class="page">Page 452</span></a> blind
intuitions as rational knowledge have been in many cases catastrophic.
</p>

<p class="include">
If reason has slain its thousands, the acceptance of instinct as
evidence has slain its tens of thousands. Day by day, in the ordinary
direction of their lives, men have learned during hundreds of
generations how untrustworthy is the interpretation of fact which
Instinct offers, and how bitter is the truth contained in such
proverbs as "Anger is a bad counsellor," or "Love is blind." ...
Wars are often started and maintained, neither from mere blind anger,
nor because those on either side find that they desire the results
which a cool calculation of the conditions makes them regard as
probable, but largely because men insist on treating their feelings
as evidence of fact and refuse to believe that they can be so angry
without sufficient cause.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Graham Wallas: <i>The Great Society</i>, pp. 224-25.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Empiricist insists that the morality of an act cannot be told
from the intensity of approval or disapproval which it arouses in
the individual. Actions are not moral or immoral in themselves,
but in their consequences or relations, which are only discoverable
in experience. The goodness or badness of an act is measurable
in terms of its consequences, and the consequences of action are
discoverable only in experience. This does not imply that we calculate
the results of every action before performing it, or measure the
consequences of the acts of other persons before judging them. Our
immediate reactions are frequently not the result of reflection
at all, but are responses prompted by previously formed habits,
or by instinctive caprice. These immediate intuitions are not to
be relied upon as moral standards, precisely because reflection
frequently comes to an estimate of an act, directly at variance
with our instinctive reaction to it. We come, upon reflection,
to approve acts that we are, by instinct, moved to condemn. And
the reverse holds true.
</p>

<p class="include">
When we see that a child's clothes have caught fire, we do not
need to reflect on any consequences for universal well-being before
we make up our minds that it is a duty to extinguish the flames,
even at the cost of some risk to ourselves. It is clear that the
act will <a name="page_453"><span class="page">Page 453</span></a>
conduce to pleasure and to the avoidance of pain. We should feel
an equally instinctive desire to kick out of the room a man whom
we saw making incisions in the flesh of a human being if we did
not know that he was a surgeon, and that the making of incisions
will tend to save the man's life. Were a competent physician to
suggest that the burning of the child's clothes upon its back would
cure it of a fever, every reasonable person would consider it his
duty to reconsider his <i>prima-facie</i> view of the situation.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Rashdall: <i>Ethics</i>, pp, 51-52.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Empiricist insists that moral standards are matters of discovery;
that the laws of conduct must be derived from experience, just
as must the laws of the physical sciences. To condemn an act as
evil means that the performance of that act has in experience been
found to produce harmful results. Those moral laws which at the
present stage of civilized society seem to have attained universal
assent, <i>have</i> attained it because they are rules whose practice
has, in the history of the race, repeatedly been found to produce
desirable results. Even the conception of justice, which has by so
many thinkers been held to be absolute, to inhere somehow in the
nature of things, is by Mill demonstrated at length to be merely
a particularly highly regarded utility:
</p>

<p class="include">
It appears ... that justice is a name for certain moral requirements,
which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the scale of social
utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation than any
others; though particular cases may occur where some other social
duty is so important as to overrule any one of the general maxims
of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but
a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine,
or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical
practitioner.[2]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 2: Mill: <i>Utilitarianism</i> (London, 1907), p. 95.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Indeed it is clear, that in the processes of natural selection
those tribes would survive whose rules of morality did in general
promote welfare. And it is the business of reflection, says the
Empiricist, not to accept either his own conviction or those of
others on ethical questions, but in cases of ambiguity <a
name="page_454"><span class="page">Page 454</span></a> to establish,
after inquiry, a standard the practice of which promises the widest
benefits in human happiness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Ethics and life.</b> All ethical theories are more or less
deliberately intended as definitions of the good, and as instruments
for its attainment. They must, therefore, be immediately tested
by their fruits in life. An ethical theory that is only verbally
concerned with the good, but does not in practice promote human
welfare, is futile pedantry or worse. Reflection upon conduct arises
in man's attempt to control the nature which is his inheritance in
the interests of his happiness. Men have learned through experience
that to follow each impulse without forethought brings them pain,
misery, and sometimes destruction. They have found that to achieve
happiness some harmony must be established between competing desires,
and that only by balances, adjustment, and control, can they make
the most of the nature which is theirs inescapably. This nature
consists, as we have seen, in certain specific tendencies to action.
Men are natively endowed with instincts to love, to fight, to be
curious, to long for and enjoy the companionship of their fellows,
to wish privacy and solitude, to follow a lead and to take it, to
fear and hate, and sympathize with others. The satisfaction of
any one of these impulses gives pleasure. Any one of these may
become a dominant passion. But it is not through yielding to a
single imperious impulse that men attain genuine happiness. To be
excessively pugnacious or amorous or fearful is to court unhappiness,
both for the individual and his fellows. It is only by giving each
instinct its proportionate chance in the total context of all the
instincts, that happiness is to be found.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is for this reason that, as Aristotle first pointed out, a study
of what is good for man must start with a study of what man himself
is. The study of ethics must consequently fall back for its data
upon psychology. It must note with precision the things that men
can do, before it tells them what they ought to do. For the things
they ought to do, are <a name="page_455"><span class="page">Page
455</span></a> dependent on the conditions which limit and determine
their ideals. Any ethical system that deliberately excludes from
its formulation natural human desires and capacities, is denying
the very sources of all morality. For every ideal has its root back
in some unlearned human impulse, and an ideal that has no basis
in the nature of man, is not an ideal, but a negation. The ideal
"way of life" is one that provides for the harmonious utilization
of all those possibilities which lie in man's original nature.
To deny a place to the sex impulse is to deny a place to ideal
love. To deny the moral legitimacy of the fighting instinct is to
take away the basis of that immense energy which goes to sustain
great moral reformers. The place of ethical theory is not to deny
human impulses, but to turn them to uses in which they will not
hinder other impulses either of the individual or of others. Through
physical science, men have sought to make the most of their physical
environment; through moral science, they can try to make the most
of the human equipment which is theirs for better or for worse.
This human equipment is an opportunity; and the utilization of this
opportunity constitutes happiness. It is in the realization of the
possibilities offered by our original human nature that reflection
upon morals is justified. It is in the effective fulfillment of
this opportunity that its success must be measured.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Morality and human nature.</b> A moral theory that is merely
coercive and arbitrary, therefore, is not in a genuine sense moral.
A morality, to justify itself, must appeal to the heart of man.
The good which it recommends must be a good which man can without
sophistry approve. And the good for which man can whole-heartedly
strive is not determined by logic, but, in the last analysis, by
biology. Human beings cannot freely call good that to which they
have no spontaneous prompting. Those ascetics who have denied the
flesh may have displayed a certain degree of heroism, but they
displayed an equal lack of insight. For it is out of physical impulses
alone that any ideal values can arise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_456"><span class="page">Page 456</span></a> It is only
when one instinct interferes with its neighbors, or one individual
with his fellows, that instincts or activities can be called evil.
They are called evil in relation, in context, with reference to
their consequences. In itself no natural impulse is subject to
condemnation. It is just as natural as thunder or sunshine, and
is to be taken as a point of departure, as a basis for action,
rather than as a chance for censure. Impulses demand control simply
because, left to themselves, they collide with each other, just as
individuals uncontrolled by custom, law, and education, collide
with each other in the pursuit of satisfaction. The ideal is a way
of life, which will allow as much spontaneity as the conditions
of nature and life allow, and provide as much control as they make
necessary. To be thus in control of one's desires is to be free.
It is to utilize one's interests and capacities in the light of a
harmony both of one's own desires, and in so far as this harmony
is universal, of the desires of all men. It is to lead the Life
of Reason:
</p>

<p class="include">
Every one leads the Life of Reason in so far as he finds a steady
light behind the world's glitter, and a clear residuum of joy beneath
pleasure and success. No experience not to be repented of falls
without its sphere. Every solution to a doubt, in so far as it is
not a new error, every practical achievement not neutralized by
a second maladjustment consequent upon it, every consolation not
the seed of another, greater sorrow, may be gathered together and
built into this edifice. The Life of Reason is the happy marriage
of two elements&mdash;impulse and ideation&mdash;which if wholly
divorced would reduce man to a brute or to a maniac. The rational
animal is generated by the union of these two monsters. He is
constituted by ideas which have ceased to be visionary and actions
which have ceased to be vain.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Santayana: <i>Reason in Common Sense</i>, p. 6.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nor does the leading of a moral life, as Kant and other moralists
said or implied, demand a stern and lugubrious countenance and
a sad, resigned determination to be good. A moral system should
promote rather a hallelujah than a halo. One may suspect the adequacy
to human happiness of <a name="page_457"><span class="page">Page
457</span></a> those moral systems which promote in their holders
or practitioners a virtuous somberness and a moral melancholy. A
morality that demands such unwholesome outward evidences is inwardly
not beautiful. As art is an attempt to give perfection and fulfillment
to matter, so is morals an attempt to give perfect and complete
fulfillment to human possibility. A genuine morality will, in
consequence, be spontaneous and free. In Matthew Arnold's well-known
lines:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Then, when the clouds are off the soul,<br />
&nbsp; When thou dost bask in Nature's eye,<br />
&nbsp; Ask, how <i>she</i> view'd thy self-control,<br />
&nbsp; Thy struggling task'd morality.<br />
&nbsp; Nature, whose free, light, cheerful air<br />
&nbsp; Oft made thee, in thy gloom, despair.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br /><br />
"There is no effort on <i>my</i> brow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; I do not strive, I do not weep.<br />
&nbsp; I rush with the swift spheres, and glow<br />
&nbsp; In joy, and when I will, I sleep."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: From <i>Morality</i>.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Morals, law, and education.</b> No moral code, however adequate
in its theoretical formulation or the means of its attainment,
is socially effective merely as theory. No matter how completely
it takes into account all the natural desires and possibilities
which demand fulfillment, it remains merely an academic yearning.
It becomes an instrument of happiness only when it has been made
the habitual mode of life of the individual and the group, through
the long continuous processes of education and law. There is a
familiar discrepancy between theory and practice, even when the
discrepancy is not due to insincerity. Philosophy cannot make a man
virtuous, however much it may convince him of the path to virtue.
Socrates thought that if men only knew the good they would follow
it. But modern psychologists and ordinary laymen know better. The
good must become a habitual practice if men are to follow it, and
it can only become a habitual practice if education and social
conditions in general <a name="page_458"><span class="page">Page
458</span></a> provide for the early habituation of the individual
to conduct that is socially useful. Aristotle, who himself framed
a theory of morals that was built on the firm foundation of human
possibility, was aware of the inadequacy of theory by itself to
make men good:
</p>

<p class="include">
Some people think that men are made good by nature, others by habit,
others again by teaching.
</p>

<p class="include">
Now it is clear that the gift of Nature is not in our own power,
but is bestowed through some divine power upon those who are truly
fortunate. It is probably true also that reason and teaching are
not universally efficacious; the soul of the pupil must first have
been cultivated by habit to a right spirit of pleasure and aversion,
like the earth that is to nourish the seed.[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Aristotle: Ethics, book X, chap. X, p. 344 (Weldon
translation).
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is only when people find pleasure in the right actions, that
they can be depended upon to perform them. And it is by their early
and habitual performance that they will become pleasant. In the
formation of such socially and individually useful habits, education
is the incomparable instrument. The conduct of individuals is, as we
have repeatedly seen, largely fixed by the customary recognition of
certain acts as approved, and others as disapproved. These approvals
and disapprovals are transmitted through education. Education is used
here to refer not simply to the formal institutions of teaching, but
to the complete social environment, the approvals and disapprovals
with which an individual comes in contact. Formal education is,
however, the chief means by which society inculcates into younger
members those values, traditions, and customs which its controlling
elements regard as of the most pivotal importance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Social customs which are transmitted in education, become fixed
in law. So that, as Aristotle points out in this same connection,
laws are symptomatic of the moral values which the group regards as
of the highest importance. Laws are customs given all the sanction,
support, and significance that the group can put into them. Education
transmits the values, <a name="page_459"><span class="page">Page
459</span></a> ideals, and traditions cherished by the group, but
the laws and customs already current largely control the scope
and methods of education. "Education proceeds ultimately from the
patterns furnished by institutions, customs, and laws. Only in a
just state will these be such as to give the right education."[1]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Dewey: <i>Democracy and Education</i>, p. 103.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The state of law and education which is exhibited by a society,
thus accurately mirrors the degree of moral progress of the group.
And what is, perhaps, more significant, the kind of law and education
current determines the moral ideals and conditions the moral
achievements of the maturing generation. Education, more especially,
is the instrument through which the young can be educated not only
to ideals and customs already current, but to their reflective
modification in the light of our ever-growing knowledge of the
conditions of human welfare.
